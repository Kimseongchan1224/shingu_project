you will have great piece of technology in your ears at low cost just enjoy them ,0
you sound very terrible on this headset you can mute yourself even with doing the mic mute switch and your sound is very quiet compared to other head sets it cheaper than most head sets but their are some big setbacks would not buy again would not recommend,1
you have to scream into the mic and the volume is low ,1
you get what you pay for weak mic requires manual adjusting through computer sensitivity is low so you may have to raise it or scream into the mic ,1
you get fantastic sound quality for pretty good price hands down the best ve ever spent ,0
you could hear everything that is going on in game and the noise cancellation is amazing ,0
yeah know it relatively cheap but didn expect it to be that feeble the sound and recording quality is pretty bad might as well just talk through laptop open mic even with software noise suppression the listening quality is pretty awful worthless for music listening the mic itself is has poor response and acquisition then there the usb which is only used to light the headset leds up really just shabby ,1
wouldn take charge and charge light kept turning off just as bad the keyboard lighting wouldn stay on which defeats its whole purpose very disappointed and returning product ,1
wouldn spend your money on these cheaply designed broke within week volume is not that great save your money and spend little more to get decent pair,1
would ve given star but not as impressed with battery life as much as was with the charge other than that sound is impeccable as expected ,1
worthless to spend min trouble shooting every time need to use it ,1

worst wireless mouse have ever purchased the lag time to respond to movement is horrble clicking is even worse sometimes have to click three or four times before the mouse works tried on multiple systems just to be sure it was not an issue with one laptop do not purchase complete waste of money and time ,1
worst mouse ever it double clicks when do not want it to the mouse barely moves and is jerky when used and often makes the cursor slide to the upper right of the screen without me moving the mouse ,1

wish hadn missed the return window on this one this mouse does not have range of meters as stated it has difficulty tracking at just meter or even couple of feet away this was supposed to replace mouse from another seller that also had trouble with it turned out to be the same exact mouse it disheartening to find out that multiple companies are selling the same useless products would recommend spending little more money on mouse from reputable brand ,1

unboxed this today and couldn listen for more than an hour muted sound no treble just overloaded with bass removing the extra bass with the bluetooth volume reduction buttons combo to produce flat sound didn help jbl hk should invest in an eq app asap to allow users increase the higher frequencies to produce their preferred output balance can even live with just preset eq settings but not this jbl didn listen to all the charge criticisms about sound quality very disappointing packaging back up to return total waste of time,1
unacceptable days after purchase trackwheel stopped working everything else works except that so frustrating to not have that for easy access ,1
udpate you can use control shift together on the left side of the keyboard quick tab opens window movement what an abusrd error do yourself favor and buy different keyboard this keyboard hits all the nails except for the spacebar it seems to be made of an entirely different plastic than the rest of the keyboard and is distractingly loud if you re working in an office environment it likely you ll get looks from your co workers it ruins the entire keyboard experience ,1
tried times using this in the week ve had it even checked to make sure it was fully charged turned it off on several times and no improvement movement of cursor is very slow delayed very disappointed with functionality went back to using my battery operated mouse ,1

this keyboard stopped working terrible keyboard doesnt do all the function it shows to it description avoid this product way overpriced and klim support is also terrible too ,1
this keyboard may look cool but that about it the keys are not button like like the one brand normally use so typing with average size nails is difficult it makes way too much noice for my comfort am returning the product because it doesn meet my expectations ,1
this keyboard looks really good but the description is deceiving as they claim it to be silent or quiet this keyboard is so not close to being quiet one it has really loud keys which wasnt fan of ,1
this keyboard looks good on my desk and is very good for coding ,0
this keyboard looks fantastic especially with the breathing setting but the connectivitiy is garbage it makes gaming fristrating because the keybiard will lag you will put in an input and it will take few seconds to register if it registers at all there is also no indicator if it is about to die fully charged it still lags ,1
this keyboard looked like it was going to be exactly what wanted but it died soon after got it ,1
this keyboard lives up to everything that is promised in its description would recommend ,0
this keyboard is very good and the best part is their excellent costumer service ,0
this keyboard is the best purchased of them for work and my son schooling ,0
this keyboard is deceptive it really pretty and feels good to use but in about months of use it started having response issues use it for gaming and it would randomly stop responding or lag for few seconds to minutes before recovering it does this regardless of charger status and even when plugged in used it directly next to the receiver and on different machines so it isn the bluetooth on my end or distance affecting it think either the keys lose responsivity or the bluetooth signal is losing connection ,1
this keyboard is ass dont buy it please so many typos from bad connectivity less than month in and it cant even hold charge now complete waste of money if we humor it not breaking so quickly the auto off feature of seconds of inactivity horrible and cant be disabled this is bad product in lot of ways,1
this keyboard is amazing while wish the rhb was addressable really cannot complain,0
this keyboard does not work properly am not sure if mine is defective or not but reading other reviews can see that other people have similar issue would be in the middle of typing sentence and it misses about of the letters in the sentence it appears to be battery issue the keyboard barely charges the blue light for charging turns off within minute of plugging it in and then minutes later the keyboard starts being unresponsive again and you have to unplug it and then plug it back in for it to work again properly ,1
this item is poorly made battery died within minutes after full charge hours it was returned the same day it was delivered ,1

this is the worst wireless mouse ve ever had the displeasure of using bought it thinking how bad can it really be it just needs to connect to my laptop well if this could be negative star rating would do it if you stop moving the mouse for seconds or more you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again because it loses its tracking and doesn respond to your movements it doesn have any accuracy while clicking things and its uncomfortable to use it is garbage ,1

this is the bang for your buck but before you get too wild about it there are some things you should note after some use the keyboard gets little squeaky dont know if got defective product but for me whenever was trying to press while holding spacebar the would not register leaving me stuck with another inventory slot this makes it really bad for action games because if you were to switch to the second slot you would have to let go of spacebar if those things dont bother you buy this keyboard its amazing ,1

this headset is extremely comfortable and has great sound quality but unfortunately has an annoying static buzzing sound when talking to my friends very disappointing ,1
this headset is complete garbage the usb plug wouldn work only lights up the headset using the audio plug the sound is staticy and you can barely hear at full volume listening to music video to test the sound was chopping cutting out the artists voice all over the place worst headset have ever used opened return immediately ,1
this headset died after less than month of regular use no loud music only used for gaming voice chat they just randomly died total junk save your money buy something else ,1
this gaming headset does not light up when you play this only lights up when plugged in to the usb for charging only initially bought it because thought the led would show when gaming which is the main purpose but was wrong plus the cables are way to short to have it plugged in and the surround system is bad wouldn recommend buying this cheap mic ,1

these headphones are very cool looking and you can beat the price good quality too ,0
these headphones are nice to look at but the microphone sucks most gamers of any level or even someone who needs to use it for zoom conferences needs decent quality mic this is not that the positive reviews must only be focused on the sound and the look just got these couple hours ago and will be returning smh,1
these headphones are awful static every time you move not worth rather spend and get something decent,1
these have been pretty good so far really good deal for the price ,0
these ended up being bit of disappointment we got them for our son for christmas and we didn realize that in order for the lights to work the cord also needs to be plugged into usb port he was using them mostly with tablet so this was bummer now only three months later the cord has completely severed and they don work at all these have had extremely light wear and tear never leaving the house and only used for couple hours day ,1

there was no usb adapter included so it essentially useless if you need it for usb system ,1
there is no lighting up of the headset unless very short cord is in the usb same time as the other that is plugged into the gaming unit that falsely advertised it sounds good and works good but no lights at all that mainly why picked this one bummer ,1
there is no audible warning when the battery is low the indicator lights are at the bottom of the speaker the way you know is when the speaker turns off in the middle of the night and you fumble with the charger while the speaker keeps turning off until the battery gets charge sound quality is nothing special considering the price and the jbl brand ,1
there amazing spent on pair that is half as good as this,0

the stupid lights cannot be turned off it runs the battery flat every night if you forget to recharge the mose you are sunk in single day it is uncomfortable and decides you have released mouse key by itself very annoying it is in my rubbish bin ,1

the sound isn as good as had hoped but the awful range of the bluetooth was the absolute deal breaker fully charged it can keep solid bluetooth connection to my computer that literally feet across the living room it breaks up so bad that it was unbearable to listen to wondering if the problem was actually my computer switched to little jbl clip that have and it worked flawlessly the charge was total failure and is being returned to best buy ,1
the sound is great and it very easy for old people to use ,0
the sound is decent but the microphone does not work at all fix your crap frustrating and returning never again will buy this ,1
the sound is crystal clear and the wire prevents easy entanglement but ve noticed something after couple of weeks of use the ear pieces aren comfortable for adults due to them being too small and what even worse is that wear glasses and it makes it even more uncomfortable for me and even making it difficult to focus during gaming have to constantly try to move them around just for it to be bearable in comfort so warning not recommended with glasses and or adults ,1
the sound is amazing you can even charge your phone its incredible,0
the sound is amazing for such smaller product it produces lot of sound ,0
the sound for the head set is ok but not good or amazing in any way it hard to hear the people talk sometimes it sounds like they re far away or something it is also heavy on the cable side it feels clunky dealing with it,1
the sleep mode is ridiculous they stated the lights keep on seconds and nit true they stay few seconds worst keyboard ever,1
the size is perfect for me it is portable so can listen wherever am ,0

the overall headset is comfortable nice sound quality and all around great ,0
the overall audio is really good but you can only hear from one side of the headphone and every often you can hear static noise that is coming from the headset and the only way you can fix it is by unplugging and plugging back in and know that not exactly you know annoying or an inconvenience but it is kind of annoying to you know having to unplug and plug back in,1
the only way the lights works if you plug into the xbox port then there is inch cord to plug into the controller for the mic which doesn work very poor design ,1
the only thing that is bad is that you cannot use it on chromebook laptop without gaming tower ,1
the noise cancellation is great sound quality is very loud overall this is great product ,0

the mouse worked great loved it actually but the charging cord is severed and while it does charge it also will shock you little if you accidentally touch it while plugging into charging port or plugging the mouse in and because the charging cord is only inches hard to refrain from touching where it is severed will stop using this when new different mouse arrives ,1

the mouse worked adequately when it arrived after couple weeks it started going through periods where the sensor was unresponsive one minute and then worked fine the next at this point its mostly unusuable it has an annoying habit of losing connection and suddenly staring straight up while gaming makes fast paced competitive games nearly impossible waste your money on some other brand piece of junk mouse ,1

the laser stop working after having the mouse for about months disappointing ,1
the keys would do the wrong function and it was missing several options ,1
the keys where not sensitive enough but overall it pretty good for gaming ,0
the keys are very easy to type on but hate how the keyboard has positive tilt built in this is bad for one wrists ,1
the keyboard wouldn even charge or stay on you could charge it all day too watch it die in seconds the moment turned it on,1
the keyboard is great just don like that the rgb lights turn off every seconds,0
the keyboard is definitely quiet but the enter key is in an awkward position if you learned how to type and don hunt and peck you will constantly be hitting the slash key rather than the enter key this gets very frustrating when trying to type reports and documents it has nice look and my kids thought it was cool with the colors but sadly it was returned due to it not being practical for my needs,1
the keyboard feels great looks great but it not nearly special enough for how often it needs to be plugged in it has died on me in the worst situations never any sort of warning and happens roughly once every weeks would much rather have hardwired or battery operated keyboard than this battery life is frankly unacceptable,1
the keyboard did not function correctly the moment opened plugged it some of the keys just don work received broken keyboard and it pain to return due to covid ,1
the key board is great it is exactly what needed for my desk ,0
the jbl charge is awesome the sound is incredible the battery life is amazing ,0
the idea of this mouse sounded nice and fun however was very disappointed to see that the usb is slightly bigger than other usb cables and it did not fit into my laptop or any other usb port for that matter perhaps this one was defective but this was unacceptable would give zero stars if could ,1

the headset itself is pretty but it big on my head without the ability to adjust the lights on mine don turn on no matter what do the sound quality isn bad it just isn loud at all even at the highest setting still use them for horror games but if you like your games loud wouldn recommend this headset ,1
the headset is very comfortable and the sound quality is great especially for the cost ,0
the headset is really comfortable great quality and really really good overall,0
the headset is perfect for gaming purposes the sound quality is extravagant,0
the headset is nice but the cord on the actual product is different from the instructions there are two jacks one for the game controller and usb connection to power the lights if you look at the pictures the split is further down closer to the jacks than what is explained in the instructions doubt anyone would be able to use the lights unless they re sitting next to an outlet also there isn much room to use the controller if the usb is connected to power source poor design of the cord ,1
the headset is extremely comfortable and works great it also looks amazing so strongly recommend ,0
the headphones themselves are okay but the microphone is horrible it not flexible or adjustable in any way so you can actually get close enough to it to sound better than muffled to anyone else in voice chat it sounds like you re speaking through wad of cotton or from another room have no idea how this has gotten so many five star reviews when the microphone is so so bad ,1
the have great sound and work what need them for also the shipping was quick,0
the freaking thing broke before could even use it was out of town for few weeks so by the time noticed it the return date had expired ,1
the fit is very comfy and the quality meets me expectations great headphone for the price ,0
the ergonomics are good but it has fatal flaw that makes it unusable when you first turn it on it works fine but after minutes or so it becomes very twitchy or jerky and completely unusable tried it on both macs and pcs same problem with both systems it too cheap to bother sending back but want to warn others not to make the same mistake ,1

the aux input doesn work properly the sound keeps cutting out this is simply bad design and when contacted jbl support about this here was their official response our jbl charge normally goes on standby when there is no sound coming out of the speaker for while this feature can be turned off they called their poor design feature much in the same way faulty brakes on car is feature they also solicited me for star review and incentivized me with gift card so stars ,1
the audio quality from the headphones is pretty great but the mic could be better ,0
the audio is mostly decent but as soon as started talking all my friends told me sounded so badly should go back to my old mic bad output just slightly uncomfortable but not too bad overall,1

quality of sound is good however volume level compared to previous model sucks and the bluetooth changed so now the old models can connect to the new models that really dumb to not have back compatible technology my sister has previous model and it fills back yard of several acres can barely hear this across my warehouse would say it to as loud as previous bought it to hear above the refrigerator units and its disappointing for the price oh well guess that the price you pay for buying something online that you can hear the exact unit first ,1
purchased two connection between the speakers is good but the bluetooth connection between the source is by far the worst have ever had constant clipping does not matter if ft apart or lot of sound when connected but will drive you crazy with the clipping not worth the money not even worth half the price do not buy my mistake ,1

package was opened and parts were missing had charging cable bu no other parts paid fo new product,1
overall underwhelming headset given it cheap price sure it could meet your needs don like that the ear muffs don turn so its kind of uncomfortable to wear can imagine wearing these for long periods of time the chord connector is obnoxiously long unless this is something you re looking for mic settings mute is all basic controls which is expected with lower price point mic overall not practical for long term use in my opinion will be returning ,1
overall they re just really good headsets you can hear everything very well,0
overall liked the feel and responsiveness but the durability was the big issue this mouse was for work computer with light everyday use and within less than two months it would no longer charge or work properly took it apart to verify the battery was making connection and even replaced the battery however the mouse still would not track properly perhaps just got dud but decided to spend few more dollars and purchase different brand ,1
outstanding honestly the best portable speaker out there connect with friends must for college ,0

only months old and already won charge pretty but not very long lasting,0
only lasted hours when fully charged quite disappointed with this product overall ,1
one problem have with these is that the cord that plugs into my controller is so stiff with no flexibility that it wants to break ,1
one ear would go back and forth between working and not working sometimes whole set would stop working and this was straight out of the package severely disappointed,1
one ear doesn even work waste of money was excited because my previous headphones broke but was extremely disappointed when the audio to the one side didn even work plus they re extremely uncomfortable if you wear glasses ,1
once got this product read the manual and did everything step by step including charging the mouse and it will not work after minutes of messing with it the led lights started flashing and got it to work for little while then it stopped again this product is not good and needed it for school but would hate to take an exam and have these issues ,1
ok so am not super tech person and am not sure if this is fixable problem or not but only one side of the headphones work that was the whole reason on buying another pair of headphones because my first pair of different brand started to break and lose hearing in one side just opened mine and yet it has the same problem other than that they seem great just wished mine worked know ,1
ok for gaming the sound is already failing on one side very disappointed ,1

noticed that after long period of wear the outside of my ears start to hurt ,1
nothing special about this keyboard not fond of the manufacturers website adding to this review after less than year of use the battery is failing one of the issues is the forced keyboard lighting there is no way to turn it off while the keyboard saw heavy use the main function wireless is hampered by poor design am reducing my review to reflect this issue after testing do not recommend this product ,1
nothing but issues the scroll wheel broke for no reason at all no longer holds charge would not recommend ,1

not worth it window to return is small broke in month ,1
not worth it had this for only months and it broke it just stopped working could not scroll at all no matter what did not worth the money then after contacting amazon was charged dollar restocking fee for them and had to send it back on my own ,1
not very good honestly it doesn get very bright and there is on different light modes most of the keys are only half lit and is hard to see during the day all in all not impressed with it will be returning it not worth the money,1
not the best headphones ve purchased doesn provide the same quality for headphones less the price ,1
not sure for games but its really comfortable and pretty cool with the colors,0
not really worth it since the extra wires get in the way if your buying for xbox or playstation it terrible because not only do the lights not work but you need to plug the usb into your consol without plug for the usb it just gets extremely annoying to use the sound quality okay for the price ,1
not installed on my pc but the user is pleased the lighted feature is worthwhile ,0
not happy with this headset other gamers complained about the background sounds and made remark about buying cheap headset ,1
not great item for long term use could be more sturdy ,1
not great item for long term use could be more sturdy ,1
not good at all but did pay cheap for it uncomfortable sound is not that good and short mic wouldn buy again ,1
not going to lie not particularly impressed with this keyboard the reaction time is not all that great but what is really annoying is that there is no warning when the battery is low so you can be playing game and suddenly it stops working also no way that have found to tell how charged it is,1
not extremely loud but bass is good pair and its worth the buy ,0
not cheap speaker and used it for less then months and it just stops battery is full and it was waste of maney,1
not attractive when lit up because the light leaks through the white shell just not attractive,1
not attractive when lit up because the light leaks through the white shell just not attractive,1
not at all impressed with the sound quality for the price expected much better update after months of use downgrading to star for mediocre sound quality and no bass is completely unacceptable no chance buying jbl again ,1
not as loud as was expecting for the price that paid idk if there was something wrong with mine but it seems to loose connection to my iphone pro max after few minutes,1

my only real complaint is that every time you actually turn the switch off when you switch it back on it goes back to full lights that personal preference know but only turn the lights on occasionally you should also know that the positioning of the colors is not changeable they are on pulsing on off or off no ability to change any of the lights which is fine by me but might bother other people ,1

maybe this is just personal preference but the single offset speaker is very distracting if you hold it in front of you you can immediately notice that there no sound coming from the left side initially thought maybe mine was defective as why would such an expensive device be mono did more research and learned it was designed that way the sound quality is still excellent just personally can look past the unequal sound distribution ,1

jbl uses non standard charging port if you misplace your cord none of the hundreds of other charging cords you have laying around will work knew about this and no surprise still managed to misplace it my tone is polite but actually seething about this tired old engineered money grab tactic thousands on thousands of other manufacturers chose standard readily available port and cord to hell with you for not doing the same at this stage in the game it just good sense and basic common courtesy ,1

i am very much casual gamer but even so would not recommend this keyboard to anyone latency is awful keystrokes are either missed or repeated which means wouldn even use this for office applications yeah it is cheap guess except that you might as well set your on fire why not save little more and get something of quality that will actually hold up to the task for which you bought it also you know it mediocre junk when amazon does not even want it sent back as return ,1

dislike completely do not buy do not pass go this product is useless for its intended purpose yes want to use the light feature which requires me to plug in the usb cable which is only long same length as the audio cable that plugs into the controller unless your willing to sit with portable charger this product is of no use to me and recommend anyone that wants to use the product for its intended purpose to wait until they make the cable an adjustable length veteran nerd out ,1
disappointed with this product stops tracking after few seconds of usage regardless of how have it charged faulty product ,1

crap quality several keys fell off when it was being stored not even in use and are now lost rendering the keyboard useless down the drain ,1

cool little speaker but jbl straight up lies when they say it connects to your other jbl speakers they advertise that it connects to up to other jbl speakers but it isn true have another jbl which is why purchased this one it does not connect to my other jbl speaker called customer service and they confirm that it will not connect to my other jbl speaker it is complete bait and switch poor customer service and straight up lies on the part of jbl ,1

cheap product did not last long and wireless connectivity is horrible,1
cheap plastic feel right out the box the audio would cut out just from moving the wire even the most basic movement caused it to short out horrible sound quality when it did work even at the highest level it was barely audible got the headset because of the high ratings but looking at the lower scores it would seem that my issue isn an isolated occurrence ,1
cheap plastic breaks very poor design penny wise hundred stupid return games with ups gas burned life wasted heartbroken birthday gift paper wasted stress the arm holing microphone moveable to adjust snapped off was taped on better and stronger then the whole thing combined looks great blue lights not ,1
cheap af audio is the worst ve had garbage all around,1

battery life seems to be decent have two of these and both have issues with the dpi randomly changing itself so have to click the button to change it numerous times day every now and then the one use at home doesn connect when turning on the computer have to unplug re plug the dongle do have it plugged into usb switch but seeing as it the only device that encounters this issue don believe the problem is the switch not likely to buy this again it been too frustrating ,1

battery life is no good followed manufacturer procedure for the initial charge frequent disconnect from usb adapter lighting is about the only good thing constantly missing keystrokes while typing as it is right now as write this claims to be quite typing nope don get that either hard of hearing and its annoying would look somewhere else should ve returned it,1
battery life is great being able to use it as charger for other devices like to charge cell phone also major plus but where it suffers is the sound quality as others have mentioned the mono speaker is definitely weak point though the bass output is decent for its size the speaker barely seems to get as loud as our flip also when connected via bluetooth to our samsung tv for is quite noticeable lag in audio once again in comparison to the flip ,1
battery life and sound quality are great very happy with my purchase ,0
battery lasts less than half the time advertised not sure if received defective products or what previous version lasted much longer ,1

bass is weak volume is low no way to adjust this was more than the oontz angle bt speaker that got three years ago and it not better at all holding down the bt button with the button simply causes the speaker to unpair and power down these are not helpful don waste your money on this if you re looking for anything other that very poor bass and it overheats like snowflake in the sun so if you want to take it to the beach don just don buy this ,1
basicmisleading nothing special random usish logo offensive marketing per far too often ,1

after months of somewhat daily usage just for checking emails occasionally or something fast the middle wheel stopped working making it pain in my ass to use would recommend staying clear since it only has day warranty ,1
after months it started missing key stokes or double entering letters you would think it would last longer than months before having issues like this it is hard to respond quickly to things when you have to keep going back to correct words that are either missing letter or have too many letters quite disappointing time to find new keyboard ,1
after exactly two months the roller wheel in the middle broke tried prying it apart and it is not fixable and is pain to always have to use the scrollbar with the mouse the lights are kind of distracting not necessary however it does stay charged for week or more at time cheap and bought this for data work it works other than the middle wheel now and is okay for the price or if you don have high expectations ,1

 works well until it goes into sleep mode when you wake it up the cursor is incredibly laggy and skips around the only way to get that to stop is to turn it off and then back on which seems minuscule but it gets really annoy the longer you use it maybe just got defective one it got some really high marks but buyer beware video shows it being woken up then turn it off on and it works fine ,1

 update after left the below negative review the company contacted me and offered me to remove it would assume that several reviewers have taken them up on this offer and have removed negative reviews so not only is the product junk but the company has shady business practices skip it go somewhere else this is the second pair bought for my son guess didn learn my lesson the first time first one worked for two months this one worked for less than two weeks it ish for reason don waste your time ,1
 tried everything contacted the support through the website and no response since feb th after the day got the item its the th rn of feb and so waited little longer for response but nothing and so tried to connect the cord to the item again nothing and the usb as you can see in the video is connect to my computer and tried connecting it to other ports in the computer but nothing else work also tried with the charging cable to see if that would work but nothing again so am disappointed in the product,1

 there are few good things about this keyboard lights number keys wireless rechargeable but the space bar is major deal breaker for me was looking for quiet keyboard to take notes during videoconferencing the space bar is annoyingly loud even when typing without having to be quiet on conference call it is very annoying my partner down the hall can here me typing good features on this keyboard but really cannot stand the space bar it an instant return for me the worst part is they market this as quiet keyboard it far from quiet ,1
 the wireless mouse was great in the beginning weeks later it wouldn keep charge when it did charge it would only work if it was hooked up to the charger on my laptop meaning still couldn use it then would unplug it and lights started going crazy so would turn the switch off and on to try and use it epic fail waste of my hard working money then they only give you certain amount of time to return so basically it total loss ,1

 the ergonomic feel of the mouse is great and the battery life is amazing it is lightweight and feels cheap white matches my setup but it translucent and takes way from the aesthetic it is connected less than ft away and it still loses connectivity which causes it to lag it makes it completely useless to me don recommend you buy it at least not the white one and be aware of the lagging ,1

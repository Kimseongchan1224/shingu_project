i loved this keyboard when first started using it but that didn last very long haven even been using this keyboard for full month yet and it quit working completely such waste of time completely useless for working from home the usb stays plugged in all the time so can use the wireless capability but it just quit charging can press key and then it completely dies even if plug in the usb cord it will light up but no matter what key press it does absolutely nothing am returning this asap don waste your time or money garbage,1
i not rating this one star because it is cute mouse and like the design for some reason found my macbook trackpad more comfortable to use than this mouse my wrists were hurt within couple hours of using this mouse that being said used it in moderation wanted to like it however received this mouse january th as of january responsiveness has gone downhill after taking it off the charger it has short battery life it takes about seconds and moving the scroll wheel for it to respond again even then it might have some hard to ignore hiccups ,5

i really liked this mouse being able to charge it and not worry about batteries was working great up till today tried to pull the wireless usb from the chromebook and it only partially came out the cover to it was still stuck inside the port had to use tools to get it out and now it no longer usable very upset have lot of work have to get done and using mouse makes it smoother to navigate guess this would happen just after weeks of the return window closing have only had this since the end of july ,5

i use this for when am showering and got it to replace bose bt speaker that is about years old it was no longer holding charge and kept disconnecting from the bt the sound is so good ve taken it around the house with me it came partially charged so fully charged it before used it ve had it for weeks now and haven had to charge it yet the sound quality is incredible the bass is window shaking if you are on the fence get it it supposed to be waterproof too but haven tested it love it ,5
it pretty comfortable and the noise canceling is pretty good it great for gamers especially starting gamers and younger gamers however not sure if it just me because have smaller head but they could look little funny big when wearing also when playing sometimes the people that talking to don really hear me well at times or can sound low soft another thing noticed is that when it plugged into my controller it sometimes make loud static noise often not sure if it because of the cord not being put right by myself or because of the cord itself ,5
it pretty mouse just some notes plastic bit thin at the top so the color bleeds through more than the pic it fine just an aesthetic thing mouse wheel bit noisy now after some use squeeks and screetches some when scrolling battery life is fine glad can use it when charging sensitivity is off cursor moves quickly randomly as if its spazzing out thought this was battery issue but it happens when fully charged sometimes overall it fine but shouldve just bought something bit sturdier even if it was pricier gonna keep using it to get my moneys worth ,5

quality of sound is good however volume level compared to previous model sucks and the bluetooth changed so now the old models can connect to the new models that really dumb to not have back compatible technology my sister has previous model and it fills back yard of several acres can barely hear this across my warehouse would say it to as loud as previous bought it to hear above the refrigerator units and its disappointing for the price oh well guess that the price you pay for buying something online that you can hear the exact unit first ,5
this mouse has low profile which fits my hand perfectly the point glides smoothly over the screen haven seen any difference in pointer speed between the three dpi settings but it doesn matter because it is fast enough can say enough good things about the fact that this mouse is rechargeable but have been using it daily for about week and it shows no sign of running down or needing recharging the kaleidoscope effect of changing colors is cool makes me want to turn out the lights and use the computer in darkened room would definitely recommend this mouse ,5
this mouse works as advertised the changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for new mouse on amazon don really like the slim feel to it feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time also was looking for specifically usb mouse and to make this one work with usb you have to use the included adapter which ends up sticking out quite ways on the edge of your computer this is clearly stated in the advertisement just didn pay enough attention when bought the mouse ,1

very nice work done on these speakers the sound is rich and beautiful the bass function is amazing it last long the battery charge indicator is perfect and very useful these speakes las very long on single charge the only thing is little uncomfortable is the portability it big and heavy and no handles you will have to buy carrying case separately it too big for easy portability but overall am very satisfied with this device am buying two next time gave this one to granma next time will buy two to pair up it worthy very amazing sound ,5
after months stopped working none of the key functions work the keyboard is fully charged should have read the negative reviews like others have said stopped working right after the return window closed also for what this cost the lighting on it should stay on constant but it doesn you have to hit key for it to come on they charge way too much for this piece of garbage amazon needs to give more than month window for returns guess ll stick to best buy for electronics if could have gave it less than one star would have ,1
bose who why spend so much money on bose or these other brands was bose fan for most my life all my vehicles and sound systems in all my vehicles added the bose sound package the only speaker actually believe puts out better and louder sound quality for less than half the price let alone the battery life and the charging abilities over hrs of battery life and includes power back built in to hook up your cell phone or even alexa to play your tunes best speaker for the price would have spent even more on it ,5
for starters the box came cut up dont know the reason anyone would have to cut pff part of the product box maybe im being paranoid dont know also as you can see on the pictures the keyboard was totally dirty with dust stains some minor scratches here and there and what seems to be food crumbs under keys leads me to think this was being used already by seller previous to selling as brand new lights look cool amd it conmects fine to my laptop but the lack of hygiene is what got to me dont buy ,5
for the price it not bad headset sound quality is good could use sound booster like button to increase the bass or treble that just my opinion after using multiple headsets that comes with those features overall they are right in the middle as far as sound and price is concerned also the cord is alil long like foot long wish it was shorter there is also two connects at the end it split with the headphone jack and usb at the end of the cord not really big thing but it does get in the way sometimes ,1
i am fan on jelly bean type of mouse had previous jelly bean mouse that ended up giving to family member and was searching for another one to replace it and came across this one the lights is the one that did the trick for me here just love the lights other than that its nice light mouse could have been little shorter its longer mouse compared to my previous one but other than that very functional and light and can be carried in the pockets to meetings in offices which is what do primarily with this one ,1

i like this keyboard because it is huge improvement over my old non backlit unit do believe that there is alot of room for us older folks with sight problems the back lighting would be much improved by making it all one color either bright white or the bright green increasing the size of the letters numbers and symbols would also help the unit functiond well and it was easy to put into operation it is very light weight and is not as flimsy as some others who have rated it have mentioned it is keyboard not hammer ,5
i never looked into jbl before this sound quality is amazing durability is top notch it is sleek and not to bulky have not tested out the waterproof part but think leave that for another time the battery lasts very long time like it says hrs it also great backup portable charger for my phone kinda wish got the bigger one just because really liked this brand this is me saying this not someone telling me to say it but if you like protecting your things would also get the carrying case will upload picture at another time ,5
i ve had the flip for years just started going out so hope the longevity is the same for this one obviously the sound quality between flip and charge is way different but instantly impressed love that now able to charge in the truck now definitely makes some great sound in about sq ft we use these as kitchen speaker while we cook it amazing have had this for about hrs if any severe inconveniences come along will update this jbl has been long favorite of mine btw an audiophile and have installed at least car audio systems ,5
it has good sound and the mic works great usually others can hear every little thing in my house but with this one it really dialed down to just my voice so there is active noise canceling which takes some extra circuitry and passive noise canceling which is just the shape of the thing making it really just noise isolating take your hands and cup them over your ears now your hands are passive noise canceling just like these headphones it world of difference from an active noise canceling still good headset just know what you re getting ,5
it stopped working after weeks the lights would appear and it looked like it would charge but the mouse was nonresponsive to movement it worked for week or two before this happened so know how it was supposed to work before it stopped working the surface felt silky to the touch but that about the only plus can give this product as cool as the lights look wouldn recommend wasting your money on this invest little extra and go with more reputable and reliable brand that won break after weeks ll be doing the same after this disappointment ,1
not made for ps first off you need to plug in the usb connection into separate power source to get the lights to work the sound jack that plugs in to your ps controller is split with the usb but both cords are very short so you have to choose to play with the lights off if you want to use it with the ps controller comfortably if thats the case then whats the point of owning it this is made more for laptops than ps dont recommend if you are thinking of buying it for the ps ,5
price and sound are wonderful on these headset and their definitely worth the cost have of their headsets but as stated before quality is what you pay for headset will nomally last about months months in the mositerproof covering of the foam heatset randommly started peeling off like paper matche so the form headesets will gradually peel off its really purely cosemtic for now but if your ocd like me then it will bother you that beingvsaid the company is awesome on support and trues to resolve any issues they stand by their products so still must buy,1
 so far so good does what it supposed to do worked right out of the box like that don have to buy batteries for it it charges quickly lasts looking time and is compatible with my hp chromebook it has two settings solid red color only when mouse is moving and slow changing rainbow when mouse is moving and or at rest the usb tucks away into the bottom of the mouse which is where you ll find it when you open the box for the first time also comes with an adapter and short charging cable ,1

 tried everything contacted the support through the website and no response since feb th after the day got the item its the th rn of feb and so waited little longer for response but nothing and so tried to connect the cord to the item again nothing and the usb as you can see in the video is connect to my computer and tried connecting it to other ports in the computer but nothing else work also tried with the charging cable to see if that would work but nothing again so am disappointed in the product,5
after while month or two of using the mic no problems ve noticed when outside of discord call on my pc it would turn up the game playing like roblox and spotify to extreme extents and the sound quality would dip kinda just making me not wanna use them outside of call so now just close my laptop but always stay in call idk why this is problem for me maybe because it changes to mode when you are in social media call but otherwise the headset is greta for it price mic is bit loud tho ,1
i bought this because hate using the mouse pad on my laptop and it great to throw in my laptop bag and pull out when need it it charges by plugging it into the laptop but haven had to do that yet besides giving it full charge when opened it up the first time it does go into sleep mode to save the battery which took minute to figure out but once you realize that it not broken just asleep it all good overall it just basic wireless mouse that works well and is sleek and portable ,1

i especially dislike the fact that the rgb turns itself off after minute or so of no use purchased this keyboard because the one had did that if your playing game and using mouse or game controller then you don need the key oard much but when you do you can see which button is which until you strike key and activate the lighting what the point in rgb lights if they don just stay on guess ll be buying third keyboard but this time ll make sure it isn practically useless to me probably go newegg ,5
i ve tried so many wireless mice over the years and one of the most annoying has always been how quickly the battery dies and they are not included when ordered this mouse got it because it lit up and matches my laptop when got it was pleased to learn it was rechargeable mind blown and brilliant the mouse will go into sleep mode when you aren using it or you can turn it off and on easily perhaps the only con is that it doesn come with instructions absolutely love this mouse and highly recommend it ,5
i want to start with have owned many many many portable speakers in my life because im pretty rough on them go racing with them and they get kicked around and covered in dirt and mud and get thrown and all kinds of stuff but this speaker is by far the best sounding and best quality bluetooth speaker ive ever had its been run through the mill and used every day for multiple months and its still just as good as day one very nice battery life also if you re in the market buy this one ,5
i was on the fence about purchasing portable speaker as typically underwhelmed with the sound quality but this dig out of the box it was lacking little but after eqing with my phone it is punchy and exactly what am looking for large enough to carry the tech needed to produce quality sound small enough to carry around or even throw in my bicycle bag to listen while riding not much can complain about here if save up the cash might buy second one to get stereo sound but haven honestly missed it that much buy one ,5
it was great mouse until it stopped working and charging literally only used it about times since buying it and when put it on the charger this last time it just completely stopped working the charger light wouldn come on and it wouldn charge even switched usbs to see if it maybe had short in the wire and still nothing now that reading other reviews see the problem wish would have read them thoroughly before buying it buy this only if you want something short lasting with pretty colors other than that don recommend this at all ,5

item must ve been defective or something because in was it stopped working charging and pretty much would my work at will also the returns process with this vendor sucks it not via amazon had to go twice to ups because had to print the label or pay to print on site then had to also buy an envelope to ship it back in if would ve paid little bit more for higher quality would thane had to waste more time and money with the hassle save yourself the grief and get one little bit more upscale ,5

just received this yesterday and plugged it in today have left it on the charger for longer than hours because every time it says it is charged can not use it longer than min before it goes dead like the look and feel of it but did not buy it to used plugged in very disappointed and will have to buy something different the box got thrown away so guess it can not be returned at this point will give it one more day to try before choosing something different like to hope that just got lemon ,5

plain and simple this is good quality loud and portable bluetooth speaker think if you want to get the job done the jbl line is it in the year ve had it ve inspired few friends to get their own after hearing and enjoying it don fuss with eq or other features because this is my portable party speaker and out the box it tuned just fine for that if you want the best sound quality with stereo and more settings you should will probably need to spend more than what this is to get notable improvement ,5
so we ve gone thru quite few wireless items over the last few years this one by far has knocked it out of the park actually allowed my year old to pick her mouse this year she and she picked based on color read the description the review were good and the price was right so we hit buy now love sleep mode really love that it rechargeable battery lasts weeks like that it lights up when it charging and let you know when it done and an added bonus it the cutest shade of baby pink ,1

the product arrived in an undamaged box with the details of the keyboard on the back upon opening the box there was the keyboard small envelope and user manual in several languages the keyboard had the wireless connector in the back and power switch to turn it on inside the envelope was note on how the shipping was processed along with branded stickers the keys on the keyboard all work very well and do make nice clicking noise overall am very happy with this product and would be happy to get other products from the same brand ,5
this is my first speaker and love it love the bass especially like to play my lofi music at night when doing homework and the sound quality makes the energy in the room feel so much more calm and relaxing when playing my regular jams on low can still hear the bass when leave the room to go to the other side of the house and it sounds like there party next door putting it in the bathtub while you shower makes the sound expand in way so that makes for an exciting experience this speaker is ,5
this pair of headphones has worked really well for me plan on buying another pair because my current pair has gotten damaged due to my putting the pair on uneven surfaces and the wires have been tugged on too much knocked the head phones down on accident several times walked while wearing these head phones and dropped my phone the cord itself got accidentally tugged and unplugged from my phone won be using these headphones outside my room anymore also my room is well enough organized now that shouldn end up knocking them over on accident anymore ,1
very poor sound little to zero bass poor app support and miserablr battery life if you are using this for outdoor or warehouse usage it will disappoint full charge this morning granted hours of play at to volume quite far beneath the hours promised if it had lasted hours might keep it but the sound just isn worth metal music sounds terrible and you have to put your ear up to the speaker to hear it at volume how does this garbage get passed off as premium stuff returning it immediately and taking the leap to bose ,5
well just saying not sure why the price is expensive besides the lights on background of keys it is the same basic keyboard you will find in the wireless section bought cause of how cool it looks also you have to keep charging the keyboard to ensure it is fully juiced up so make sure you turn it off on the bottom so it wont die have not had to many times it died on me but how often do you remember to cut your keyboard off or plug it up other than that item is perfect ,5
 so out of boredom ordered one of these gaming keyboards this one from klim and got into the head of the gamer must say there is tangible cool factor to battle ready keyboard everything is in the spirit of the gamer there is an air of science and fantasy as you email your coworkers something really mundane aside from that here what else the klim offers the keyboard is nice and quiet accuracy is the same as with my old keyboard turning off the lights in my home office and typing from colorful keyboard is cool ,1
 update to prior review this mouse started out great was so excited about it at first then after couple months in all of the sudden the usb that goes into the computer just snaps breaks and ll add did nothing to it one day while working from home moved the laptop to start work and noticed the mouse wasn functioning looked to see why then saw the usb had just cratered into couple pieces so now paid for nothing good lord my own money too not something my office will reimburse me for either nice work ,5

don get me wrong do like this mouse it smooth pretty easy to use and overall pretty great but and this is strong but if you so much as bump the usb plug in ever so lightly all use the the mouse ceases and you have to re set it up usually use my computer on the couch with my kids next to me and sometimes they bump it or my dog or even me it could be super light and it still will make me unplug it and re do it over it really annoying ,5

first the left mouse click is not sensitive enough requiring longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click annoying and betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder longer another less significant annoyance make sure you don turn on the light feature it looks cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually changing colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse ,5

great keyboard am able to connect from another room without direct line of sight response time is excellent it does miss key from time to time but attribute that to range and signal penetration and it really not an imposition but best of all the manufacturer is both very responsive and helpful and also have great sense of humor edit spilled little coffee on it today the keyboard immediately spazzed out turned it off took it apart and cleaned and dried all of it still broken suffice it to say waterproof is not what this is ,5
i always wanted wireless mouse but did not buy one because though about the amount of batteries would go through decided to give this one try and just have to say wow charged it for the first time on for two hour like the instructions indicated and as of today it is still going strong mind you work from home and use this mouse hour day monday through saturday have not had to recharge it at all it works so smoothly and it automatically goes to sleep when not in use am super happy with it ,1
i bought this mouse so that could use it with my macbook unfortunately it barely works have tried for year now to get it to different surfaces and different ways to try and make it function better but it extremely slow and very glitchy and ends up slowing you down so much more than just using whatever mouse pad is on the laptop it extremely lightweight and made from cheap plastic was expecting that at least it would work but the lag time is so great that you re better off not using it at all ,5

i don use it for gaming that why give it three stars for that haven used sleep mode and don plan on it so gave it three stars not using that either the three stars for ergonomics is accurate because it could be little bit taller and we both have tiny hands will be small for someone with large hands for sure the colors are nice price is right oh and we like how it changes colors would buy again adapter that comes with are very convenient and worth the money paid just for the adapters ,5

i initially really enjoyed this mouse it is good size the battery life is reasonable and sucker for anything that lights up rainbow do wish that you could turn on just the mouse and not the lights without there being constant red light however after using the mouse for less than months the scroll wheel stopped working and can figure out why ve tried cleaning it out recharging the battery and adjusting my driver settings with no luck definitely frustrated and because my return window has past not sure how to reach out to customer service ,5

i just got these mins ago and tried them first off it doesn light up unless you plug both ends into port which means console players won get the light up second it just all around horrible with its sound thee most quiet whisper like sound bought it on the grounds of the high rating and good reviews but it didn come close to standards don know if this is just defective or what but this ain it and am quite disappointed in the money just gave to company that couldn even hold standard for gaming ,5
i play pc and xbox so got this mic for gaming on both or one of them didnt really care but tried it on the pc first and it wasn the best sound quality and was trying to chat with people but that didn go well so tried on the xbox hoping it would work better on there but nope it didn so now not getting this mic again cuz it was trash maybe got bad one idk so got one from walmart that work really good for everything need it for amd it was like ,5
i really like the feel and look of this mouse don like that anytime stop using the mouse for minute or two that the mouse doesn react end up turning it off and on again to get it working interrupted frequently while using the mouse so it not realistic for me to turn the mouse off every time stop using it edit today is day of using the mouse while wait to receive the other mouse bought the mouse no longer consistently turns on when turn it off and on again to stop it from lagging ,5

i was skeptical at first that such small ergonomic mouse would work pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed using it forgot to recharge it but it lets you know before it goes out by slowing down or moving from one screen to my other got it plugged in immediately and it kept right on working while it charged highly recommend this mouse and plan on buying another to have as backup for when forget to charge really love the color changing sequence the colors are bright but not overly so just enough to make it fun ,5

if you just need wireless keyboard it is as decent as any other no complaints in terms of typing the back lit function however is very weak the brightest setting really does not brighten the key lettering so you can see in darkened room what you re typing the backlit is just very nice looking dressing that brightens under the keys and constantly shuts off so you have to click something then undo before can type with the fancy light on practical level the back light is really useless just nice to look at nothing more,5
if you re looking for portable speaker for casual outings or at home say this is great purchase if you re someone like me who works in the kitchen from hours this speaker probably isn worth it with it battery life kinda expected it but didn even have it on max and it ran out on my th hour which was actually almost over an hour off from my other speaker still had pretty large for something that looks like it would have longer charge but that kinda my only gripe at least it sounds nice ,5
it is really what needed it is wireless so no more wires around my busy desktop love the background lights which makes it little different from boring black keyboards and also since it is my second keyboard for my second computer in the same desktop so really needed it to be colored differently was initially concerned about battery life but have only charged it once so far and that was more than weeks ago didn use it heavily but thought it will last max for week nice like it very much and suggest it to others ,5
like that this product is waterproof camouflage that about it the jbl charge is better product thought the would be an upgrade but in my experience in less than year the speaker now won hold charge my charge had had excellent sound long battery life only crocked because the charge port became loose after years of hefty use very displeased by the fact have to constantly charge the the sound quality doesn seem better either ve only used the charger the came with too with the was able to use the universal android which was handy ,5
the big debate about this speaker not being stereo like the charge is really mute point when the speakers on the charge are only few inches away from each other anyway not enough stereo separation to make any difference in real world listening environments in my opinion found the sound quality and loudness of the to be very impressive for such small package and would not use the fact that it only has one main speaker in front affect your buying decision at all great little speaker and long battery life just what was looking for,5
these and the other chinese brand that are exactly the same are pretty good for the price have owned andnthisnis my th pair like anything else the cable does eventually good bad at the plug end however every set has lasted me over year think the shortest time frame was about year and half and that is using them basically every day for hours on end sound is not broadcast quality by any means but it not terrible either have never had any complaints from anyone saying they sound bad or hard to understand or hear ,1
these speakers worked well for couple of months play lot of music so had to charge them have at least once week last week one of them would not power down no matter what troubleshooting did today the nd one wouldn power up no matter what did after doing some research apparently the power button is an ongoing flaw with this product my speakers are still under warranty so am going through the process of having them evaluated and hopefully replaced however being my first experience with jbl speakers which thought would be bulletproof sadly disappointed ,5
this keyboard does not work properly am not sure if mine is defective or not but reading other reviews can see that other people have similar issue would be in the middle of typing sentence and it misses about of the letters in the sentence it appears to be battery issue the keyboard barely charges the blue light for charging turns off within minute of plugging it in and then minutes later the keyboard starts being unresponsive again and you have to unplug it and then plug it back in for it to work again properly ,5
 there are few good things about this keyboard lights number keys wireless rechargeable but the space bar is major deal breaker for me was looking for quiet keyboard to take notes during videoconferencing the space bar is annoyingly loud even when typing without having to be quiet on conference call it is very annoying my partner down the hall can here me typing good features on this keyboard but really cannot stand the space bar it an instant return for me the worst part is they market this as quiet keyboard it far from quiet ,1
first off would like to say love this speaker it sounds amazing for the price and battery life is very good sit has year warranty to which had to use on my first one and have no complaints the battery quit charging so looked up the warranty and email them had no problems getting it replaced so my gripe is with the battery longevity life use mine everyday where work and getting about years out of this product but what do know not battery expert so for the price of this you can go wrong ,5
for the price paid for this headset it amazing it actually the closest to the more expensive high quality headset that have found so far it pretty good at blocking out background noise the sound effects and voices are clear to hear and can go pretty loud if you choose to turn the volume up it sits quite comfortably on my head have smaller head as female and also wear glasses when gaming so was thoroughly surprised to find there wasn too much pressure on my glasses or my ears would highly recommend this headset ,5
headset worked fine for one month and ve had it for months and it cutting in and out consistently not only the mic in parties but the speakers as well bought hyperx years ago and it still works with little to no issues still do not understand why the reviews for this product are so good you tend to trust so many star reviews but very upset with it the worst part is can get refund at this point so it was big waste of money update it broke weeks after this review was posted,5
i just recently bought two of them to be able to sync both speakers up together and it just makes the atmosphere of where you are just that much better we just recently went out to the river and it was great to have them both connected since we could have one in the water and one with everyone else who was sitting down the range on these are pretty decent as well and the battery can easily last all day but only if its not to max volume great speakers though and highly recommend ,5
i love this mouse it is very lightweight with an attractive look one of my favorite features is that it is rechargeable second you have the option of selecting one color default to red or multiple colors swap automatically the switch is on the bottom portion of the mouse my favorite feature is the fact that the mouse goes into sleep mode when you turn off your computer saved me so many times from having dead mouse it can also be charged while in use overall would definitely recommend this mouse to friends and family ,5
if you want quality sound to blast while you dance on your own while cleaning the kitchen or working on super dope motorcycle in the garage or while you roast mores up the canyon around toasty bonfire while celebrating the joys of lasting friendships buy this speaker it small enough to toss in backpack and big enough to pack an audio superpunch the battery life is amazing and can go days without charging it bluetooth connection is great and you can pair it to multiple devices which is huge win for jbl would buy again ,1
it looked like it does in the pic listing says it works with apple no clear directions on using it with the iphone terrible self support and regular support the info of setting up iphone was basically it works on some stuff might work on iphone figure it out yourself the support is none they never contacted me back and couldn get it to work so sent it back worst service ve had on amazon no excuse for not at least responding to support issue steer clear of them they don care about their customers ,5
now correct me if wrong but keyboard is meant to be used to type hooked this up to my rig and when try to type anything literally nothing happens then like secs later the first letter of what tried to type pops up then nothing happens if the description of this keyboard would ve said light up keyboard for display use only then out of stars since it is advertised as useful keyboard and gaming keyboard at that have to say don buy it buy literally anything else and maybe even letters might get typed ,1
the only adjustment personally needed to make was learning to work the sleep mode and click the button to wake it back up other than that love this mouse for work the lights on it still work almost months later with no issue the charge on the mouse plugs into standard micro usb cord and the mouse will hold charge with daily use for about days usually just end the evening plugging in to micro usb port and am always good to go grat buy and will replace with the same when the time comes ,5

this is piece of garbage it uncomfortable with small ear muffs that make it pain to wear the sound quality is subpar and the mic is so quiet unable to be heard at all even tested with my old mic and the difference is night and day even checked my windows settings and the mic was all the way up was absolutely baffled because all of the reviews here make this seem like halfway decent product but can assure you buying this is the single best way to waste money this is hunk of garbage ,5
this is the bang for your buck but before you get too wild about it there are some things you should note after some use the keyboard gets little squeaky dont know if got defective product but for me whenever was trying to press while holding spacebar the would not register leaving me stuck with another inventory slot this makes it really bad for action games because if you were to switch to the second slot you would have to let go of spacebar if those things dont bother you buy this keyboard its amazing ,1
unfortunately was in hurry when bought this and didn take the time to read the other reviews hopefully you re taking the time to read them got it and it never even turned on made sure was doing everything right and even got my dad to look too but it wouldn charge the light would turn on when plugged it in for few minutes and then turn off it looks like other people had this issue but few weeks into using it so at least it broke in time for me to return still hassle,1

update have upped my review from to since reached out to the seller and they offered to send replacement usb dongle will update the review again once that has been received would have given this mouse five stars month ago but yesterday when removed the usb dongle from my laptop the thing fell apart in my hands and the mouse is now worthless tried to piece it back together but it won stay together it shame because this mouse is really cool looking feels nice in my hand and holds charge long time very disappointed ,1

 first of all the price of this speaker is cheap for the quality sound that your getting this speaker sounds amazing the build quality is great and the fact that is waterproof and you can charge your phone from it is an added bonus so happy got it the only downside to me and this is just me being picky and annoying is that can see the battery percentage on my iphone but it does show it on the bottom of the speakers with little led dots get this speaker you wont regret it ,5
bought this for my teenage son to use for his ps gaming he has used sony gold headsets and turtle beach higher end sets and says these are an very good for the price they seem to be an excellent value this is being rated stars not that they are as good or better than the others mentioned but for the value vs quality of sound hopefully they will last decent while to truly earn the star rating gave it stars but if they don last for at least months that will be revised ,5
do not buy this mouse stopped working august st yesterday thought it was just dead so made sure to charge it this morning go to use the mouse and it still is not working despite it being fully charged it just doesn turn on anymore am extremely disappointed because just bought this mouse on june th meaning that the return window closed on july th this mouse stopped working entirely doesn even turn on anymore two days after the return window closed do not buy this product if could give it less stars would ,5

i bought this keyboard because it seemed like deal with the backlit and silent key features found the backlit features to be almost irrelevant when using in the dark because the alternating and dark colors made it difficult to see put silent keys in quotation marks because they re not really silent the keys felt no different than basic keyboard that you can buy for if you re looking for good quality and can spend more suggest logitech that why immediately unhooked it and returned it so can go back to buying the logitech ,1
i had bluetooth speaker for years and it finally died so needed to find replacement after careful research and debate decided on this model it looks slightly small but it packs punch used it the first weekend after arrival at campsite the site was booming with music and was astonished at the quality the speaker also lasted full days of almost constant use definitely my new camping speaker added bonus is you can charge phones via the speaker overall love the quality of this device my only gripe is it could be little bassier ,1
i love the way the mouse looks and feels but oh the mistakes make this mouse has mind of it own and jumps all over the place have accidentally closed files programs while working on them move public folder and having to contact it to move back and many more random errors as result of this erratic mouse sometimes while not even using the mouse can see the curser go on walkabout all over my screen perhaps there is ghost in the machine but if so they are hostile will be replacing it asap ,1

i loved this product it was gift one of the best how can you ask for anything better the quality is awesome the sound is fantastic it easy to use and understand the manual found the light colored devices get dirty quickly that the sucky part no case to keep it clean while it being used the bluetooth compatibility is also keeper getting awesome range as well just for reference the charging port tents to get lose multiple of my friends say the same thing but no worries you won regret it trust me ,5
i originally bought the sony more bass model and swapped it out for this jbl the jbl blew it away sound nut and for the size of these speaker they sound great but two and pair them and get great stereo sound buy more than two and pair them all and the stereo sound goes away so ended up with just two of them and they are perfect be sure to download the app to get the stereo sound setting put one at each end of the pool and float away to great sound ,1
i was kinda disappointed with this keyboard on one hand it great and affordable wireless keypad it feels bit cheap but it serves its purpose thought it was backlit but it not really hence the star review not sure if it me or the description of the product but was really disappointed in this regard overall though it good little wireless keyboard not great if what you re looking for is keyboard to use in dim lighting though even on the best setting it seems to go dim over very short period of time ,5
just plugged it in and it worked perfectly wanted small low profile mouse to use when travel so far this one seems great the chromebook travel with only has usb ports and did think that that this mouse came with usb receiver but it doesn it comes with usb receiver and an adapter which works fine but together they are over an inch long which is little awkward it means have to be very careful not to bump it and beak it if the receiver were smaller this would be ideal overall great value ,1
my laptop has terrible sound quality and produces sound super low both from the speakers and other headphones but these amp the sound up so that can actually hear without straining my ears and they also help with noise cancellation as my roommate can get loud at night for certain reasons if you know you know but if put these on won hear thing they don stay on too well if you move your head around ton normal movement is fine but abrupt jerky movements make them slide bit still would definitely recommend them ,5
my son received these headphones for xmas months ago they worked great for the most part the switch to turn the mic on and off was touchy he occasionally have to flip it back and forth to get it to work he said sound was great and noise canceling was ok the worst part is that he was using it today and the cable cord just came apart as far as know it not fixable unless get soldering gun but have no idea how to do any of that we have one bummed kiddo ,1
okay so ordered the jbl speaker because my mother day was coming up and my mom had always wanted her own speaker gifted it and it was working fine until like the nd month of having it it would shut off and on and it just won stay on even tho we ve charged it all night and still it won function so until get an answer back or way can fix this not so happy with it but other family members have purchased and came out fine so really don know what happen ,5
the keyboard initially works well and after few minutes when you type one the text does not appear and write several things and do not mark the text it is fault that affects my work regarding the colors it has two lighting modes the first is so that it never turns off and without colors on the keyboard and the second is so that it turns on and off thought the lighting was color by color will write the provider to help me with the key problem and that will depend on my qualification,5
the rose gold color is very pretty and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors there is an option to turn the colors off but you end up with red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around it will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to logitech or name brand get what you pay for in this case ,1

this is fair to middling keyboard the back lighting only works when it is plugged in some folks think the back lighting is just gimmicky bling thing but in darkened room its necessary and if you go cordless no back light would rather have truly cordless model with lots of batteries prefer the heft this one is very light adding to sense of cheapness it is compact still room for improvement will try another when tire of this one still searching for the one would re order this ain it but still reasonable value ,5
this is such an excellent product it quiet it in no way ever bothers my carpal tunnel and the colors are rich and vibrant the battery charge lasts for quite some time too additionally the customer service is second to none my usb dongle sadly disappeared in move and they replaced it free of charge no less within days of my email to tech support they provided ample instructions on how to sync the new receiver and even included candy in the package as friendly touch cannot brag enough about how great klim is ,5
what liked about the headphones is they are good for my games if there is bass or low tones the headphones feel like they shake bit however the headphones are only ok when cancelling noise can still hear some vehicles drive by outside it is my own fault for not reading the description carefully but what do not like about the headphones is that they need usb attachment and you have to plug it in for the lights the usb thats attached to it as cord is really short but over all like them,1
great headphones got this headset for my new remote work at home position on the phone with clients for many hours at time ear buds were hurting my ears and trying to talk through the computer speaker was making it hard to hear clients and vice versa this head set wore for hours straight and never got headache and my ears didn hurt clients voices were clear there also volume control wheel on the cord of the headset itself which has been extremely useful for switching between quiet caller and then loud caller ,5
i purchased this mouse for my new macbook pro it is so much better than the apple magic mouse was using with my imac this mouse fits perfectly in my hand and is easy to maneuver the adapter for the usb port on my mac works and fits perfectly am extremely happy with my purchase the mouse also is rechargeable which will save me money as will not be purchasing aaa batteries anymore highly recommend this product the quality and appearance of this mouse make it seem like much more expensive product stars ,5
i wanted silent mouse due to classes using proctorio with professor who was huge on thinking sounds could be cheating absolutely loved how silent it is when you press the buttons only thing haven got to work as well is the wireless aspect but it doesn bother me just plug it in for charging wise and use it as wired mouse love the changing lights as well works well for my laptop loved having light up gaming mouse for my desktop and now have something similar to use for my laptop that quiet ,5
i wanted to like this colorful keyboard unfortunately after troubleshooting for ages have been unable to fix this problem the keyboard literally just stopped working lights shut off and no connectivity regardless of the usb being connected regardless of restarting and updating my computer tried different usb ports on the off chance it was my computer but they are all working for other usb connected products have unfortunately come to the conclusion that the problem isn my computer but the keyboard don know if can return it this far out but will try ,1
jbl speakers are trash when it comes to battery had the jbl xtreme and the battery wouldn hold charge it had to be plugged in to use it finally threw that one in the garbage and bought the charge three weeks in and the speaker won charge at all the sound quality isn that great either sucky bass and only has one speaker on the right side it not worth what it costs this speaker should be no more than returning this crap and gonna look into better speaker don waste your time ,5
just what expected better than most cheap under portable bluetooth speakers as far as sound quality goes its just ok honestly was hoping it had better sound quality but it doesnt but for portable battery powered bluetooth speakers it meets expectations for the price low frequencies bass is ok mid frequencies are ok and high frequencies treble are also just ok would have preferred they made it not waterproof and had better sound quality don really care if it waterproof or not especially if that feature is going to sacrifice the sound quality,5
purchased this march th only lasted months was great while it worked but then days ago it just stopped working thought somehow plugged it in wrong and it didn charge so charged it back up for two days went to use it today and after min it stopped working again only use this for work it doesn get tossed around in backpack or anything it just sits on my desk and is used hrs day days week and is plugged back in at the end of the work day and died in months ,1

the headset is nice but the cord on the actual product is different from the instructions there are two jacks one for the game controller and usb connection to power the lights if you look at the pictures the split is further down closer to the jacks than what is explained in the instructions doubt anyone would be able to use the lights unless they re sitting next to an outlet also there isn much room to use the controller if the usb is connected to power source poor design of the cord ,5
the keyboard must be either front left or right of the keyboard not behind you like to use my computer while kicking up my legs with my wireless keyboard on my lap can do it well all the time because of the range is so poor on this keyboard would need to move the entire tower another part of the room to suit my sitting style or buy usb extender and hopefully move the signal usb stick that comes with the keyboard to in front of me than my tower being behind me ,1
the usb plug for the pc is totally useless as the pc will constantly complain about an unknown device plugged into the port contacted support what joke told me to return the product for another one no thank you this goes in the garbage where it belongs no quality control they sent me an email wanted to send me replacement no already threw it away as it stopped working you can buy my good review with cash or another of your defective products do not buy wish had read the customer reviews junk ,5
this was my second purchase pared with another charge to get stereo great sound the bass could be deeper but it still is acceptable two issues are there is no user manual and no wall charger so to pair two speakers had to rely on youtube to set it up also had to contact them to get wall charger specs using one that has volt amp output play the speakers at medium loud volume at best the battery is fairly depleted after to hours it would be great if they offered sub woofer ,5
update tried charging more often and making sure turned it off seems it doesn last as long as hoped switched back to battery operated bluetooth mouse worked well for the time being bought and the other is still working for now as of now ve tried to use it on notebook tablet and desktop to ensure it connection issue maybe it the battery but not sure if sleep mode is active the battery shouldn be having issues in such brief time of having it it should last few days after full charge overnight ,5

 update after left the below negative review the company contacted me and offered me to remove it would assume that several reviewers have taken them up on this offer and have removed negative reviews so not only is the product junk but the company has shady business practices skip it go somewhere else this is the second pair bought for my son guess didn learn my lesson the first time first one worked for two months this one worked for less than two weeks it ish for reason don waste your time ,5
colors are fun but it doesn react great charge doesn last long if you forget to turn it off over night when it low on battery it doesn work well overall it an inconvenience amending my review to include the following if you post bad review the company hassles you by email to take it down first by offering refund when you tell them not interested they then offered bucks you can pay me to take review down that the point of review just make better product you should just refund me ,5

first of all the keyboard is far from silent every time hit the space bar there is loud and very audible clack secondly just know that you can change the color scheme it just rainbow colored the whole time you can change the brightness and the speed it breathes but that it on the plus side it was ergonomic and comfortable for the minutes used it before unplugging it and preparing it for return so there that guess all in all like said returning it this is not what wanted or expected ,1
great looking speaker and the mono sound is clear and loud if you re looking for stereo don bother with the charge unable to get my two speakers to play in stereo mono party mode only contacted jbl support who said sorry but the charge is unable to play in stereo at this time our engineers are working on it and yet they are still advertising as the ability to pair two speakers to stereo with no timeline from the engineering department as to when looking for stereo speakers don buy these ,5
had the mouse charging all weekend via my desktop pc within an hour and half this of working the darn thing stopped working don know if it went into sleep mode or not but could not get it to work at all leading me to believe it lost its charge therefore had to plug it back in to charge seriously considering returning it will give it one to two more days to see if it stays charged longer than few hours if it does not will be returning it for full refund ,1
i bought this mouse specifically for its price and slim profile wanted something small and compact that is easy to pack in my laptop bag this fits the bill this mouse is perfect for everyday use such as going to websites using office applications like word excel and powerpoint etci would not recommend the mouse for gaming purposes and that is not what it is meant for anyway if you want mouse that works for web browsing office work on the go looks nice and is slim and compact get this device ,1

i find this mouse easy to use fits my hand very well wear medium sized glove and moves fairly smoothly say fairly smooth because used mouse pad with smooth soft surface it seemed to drag just little when tried smooth hard surface it worked better you do have to click button to wake up the mouse when it goes to sleep mode my other one woke up with just moving it thought that maybe the changing lights around the mouse would be distracting but dont even notice it would probably buy again ,5

i have charge that use on daily basis and loved it so decided to purchase the latest version charge as birthday gift since it was on sale for the same price as the charge that unfortunately was big mistake read the reviews about the mono speaker issues and they were spot on we played the charge and right next to each other and the charge had much richer and more immersive sound do not spend the extra for the charge save your money and get the charge promise you won regret it ,5
i have had flip and clip before bought the charge the sound quality is always great battery life always seems to last longer than need and it always connects with no problem the clip is usually in my bathroom clipped to the shower rod and the charge is great for larger outdoor parties or to have sound throughout the house find them esthetically pleasing and they blend in to my decor while giving great sound this charge was on sale and got it for less than can beat that for the quality ,5
i loved this speaker until it decided to not work it now turns on and immediately turns off it about year old and only handful of uses mostly used it in the garage fully charged battery but acts like it dead read it could be the battery installed new battery and that not it wouldn buy another one contacted jbl and they said that it was out of warranty and that since attempted to replace the battery it voided it which understand just stinks that it took premature crap out on me ,5
i rarely write reviews but this little bluetooth speaker from jbl is gem ve got high end setup in the family room and picky about sound it hard to believe the depth and bass from this little guy it actually projects decent soundstage too it on my desk and improving the quality of my days at work crank it up between calls bluetooth connect is instant and battery life very long take it out when grilling and hanging the yard very portable and gets loud without distortion how did jbl do this ,5
i really liked this mouse but had to return the first one because the wheel quite scrolling after it was knocked off my bed onto carpeted soft bedroom floor no big deal they sent me new one and sent the malfunctioning one back well the wheel has quit on this nd one too once bitten and twice shy and all that ll be returning this one as well then be off to find wireless mouse that not so sensitive and will last longer than month it really sinks liked this mouse lot ,1
i ve used this for few months it worked great at first it would die on me after few hours of using so was pretty good about plugging it in when wasn using it now it just sometimes straight up doesn work which gets pretty frustrating ll even try to keep the power chord plugged in and turn it off and on again and it still doesn work that is very inconvenient at that point ll just have to turn it off keep it plugged in and take break from whatever doing ,1
i was amazed at how light it is and requires no batteries the functions of the keyboard are simple to use and having options for the lighting is awesome super comfy keyboard on the flip side thought you could change the color settings but that no it not silent more than the character keys are quiet but the spacebar is normal clicking sound and connecting it to phone charger is preferred to plugging it into your pc to charge the pc might get bit confused great product guys and love the schwag ,1
the kids use this all the time bought the for me last summer but they use it far more got second one this year so there is always an extra around they take it from pool to porch to room to park and repeat plenty loud for those around it or around pool clear sound at volume and provides full sound even with higher bass music lot of bang for the form factor practical use is mulitdays week on charge so doesn always need charging and doesn strand you would buy again ,5
these headphones come in very nice durable box you really feel like they made it you safely the headphones themselves feel very nice and strong but still comfortable they fit on my adult head and my ear sit comfortably even with my piercings in the lights aren too bright and overwhelming but just right was surprised by the sound quality can hang these on my neck and still hear my game or music they hook up very easy and so far they seem like they will last definitely recommend them so far,1
this headset is connected to my controller and use it to play games there is mic on off switch on the headset which use to mute and unmute myself when necessary now that switch does nothing no matter what position the switch is in the mic doesn work also randomly and often there will be bunch of crackling and humming sounds that is heard by all players online at the moment coming from me this happens even with the microphone not working headphones sound quality is nice but mic needs some work ,1
when bought this mouse loved it it took me few tries to get it paired right but it is game changer for my laptop the rechargeable battery life on it is great found that if the mouse stopped responding quickly that it was time to charge it purchased it late september and at the end of april my roller has stopped working randomly it worked and then went to use it an hour later and it no longer does the scrolling wheel is an essential feature for me with my laptop disappointed ,1

bass is weak volume is low no way to adjust this was more than the oontz angle bt speaker that got three years ago and it not better at all holding down the bt button with the button simply causes the speaker to unpair and power down these are not helpful don waste your money on this if you re looking for anything other that very poor bass and it overheats like snowflake in the sun so if you want to take it to the beach don just don buy this ,5
easy installation lights don say on the entire time only when keyboard is in use only down side is that it doesn come with an extended warranty so that is something they should work on only purchased this because my spacebar went out on my laptop yes could have brought it some where to have the whole keyboard replaced but why have those noisy techs all in the business and have to order it so all tge wait nope pass now have this dope keyboard that lights up and works great ,5
great keyboard connects quickly to pc and the battery last decent amount of time the only thing wish it had that it doesn would be that the light constantly stays on but unfortunately it does not not big deal though the first keyboard they sent to me was not registering every key pressed but it was never specific to any specific keys contacted customer support regarding the issue and after having me run few tests they determined the keyboard was defective and sent me new one within two days great company,5
haven done many reviews but think this one was worth the time have hands that are bit larger than normal and feel the mouse fits well in my palm very silent mouse great for both office and home use without annoying those in the area haven used the mouse for gaming but also haven had any lag with the mouse as of now so could be good for that too overall if you are looking for wireless mouse good for work and home use with good connectivity highly recommend this mouse ,1

i ve had many headsets over the years and this one sound quality is right up there with the best of the mid priced headsets however the quality of the outgoing sound from the microphone is horrible have played with the same group of friends and they can barely tolerate the sound of my voice when playing ve tried tweaking the voice settings on my computer and have been unable to fix it when using my old headset there aren any issues other than microphone quality the headset it above average ,5
i ve taken this thing on the go for few months now and it great speaker purchased it to replace my stolen charge the quality is very good for most genres and the bass is something to appreciate the battery life is outstanding sometimes forget to turn it off disabled the power sounds for it and it easier to forget now and it will last days of just being on it very portable as long as you have decent sized bag to carry it in used my backpack very good purchase ,5
i was bit skeptical about it being quiet clicker but was pleased to learn it really is quiet the clicks are greatly muffled and are soft to the click my only complaint is that the scrolling wheel does not click quietly the lights are enjoyable but don display constant stream of colors as they forcibly manually change when moved or clicked they otherwise will rotate when the mouse is left idle overall it really nice mouse to buy and use comfortable and light kind of reminds me of the apple mouse ,5

mouse is nice thought there was an option to not have it light up since don need that function but the options are off one color and alternating many colors it only lights up while you are moving it and the light is off when its still glides good clicks well my only really issue with it is the scroller wheel can be little unreliable if want to scroll down just line or two it won move and then if scroll just little faster it zooms down the page overall decent,1

mouse is very pretty aesthetics of it is nice it handles well but it broke within couple days of getting it the button stuck wouldn click anymore unfortunately liked it so well this was the second one that ordered and the first one that ordered the rollerball stopped working but it too late to return that one so now have two broken ones the lights on at really cool the battery lasts really long time in between charging but now have two of them that have broken and six week think,1

skip past every comment besides this one best headset ever quality lmfao you see the taped cig box on the mic that the only way people can hear you threw the headset only figured this out cause was joking around about the pos with my fiancee and cuffed my hand around my mouth and the mic and it worked well cig pack is almost the right size but still works have to funnel all noise to it noise cancelation golden even the gamers voice is cancelled out unless you do this,5
so far its been really good the sound is very nice and love how fast it connects to the bluetooth when receive call the music stops and then when end my call the music automatically continues which is something really like the battery life is so good haven charged this speaker once since it has arrived and ve been using it pretty much everyday and its still good on battery it plays pretty loud at its highest volume so yeah if you re thinking about getting this speaker you totally should ,5
this is the worst wireless mouse ve ever had the displeasure of using bought it thinking how bad can it really be it just needs to connect to my laptop well if this could be negative star rating would do it if you stop moving the mouse for seconds or more you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again because it loses its tracking and doesn respond to your movements it doesn have any accuracy while clicking things and its uncomfortable to use it is garbage ,1

this product has malfunctioned and been glitchy sine the day got it the bluetooth never worked properly with the unit automatically disconnecting and shutting off kept assuming operator error but that is not the case have done factory reset and googled troubleshooting have barely used it and it no longer charges intermittently connects on bluetooth for few days this speaker would work when directly connected to my phone however after minutes the unit automatically turns off while plugged in to power troubleshoot on the web revealed many problems don buy this ,5
unboxed this today and couldn listen for more than an hour muted sound no treble just overloaded with bass removing the extra bass with the bluetooth volume reduction buttons combo to produce flat sound didn help jbl hk should invest in an eq app asap to allow users increase the higher frequencies to produce their preferred output balance can even live with just preset eq settings but not this jbl didn listen to all the charge criticisms about sound quality very disappointing packaging back up to return total waste of time,5
update seller has sent multiple emails asking me to remove this review in exchange for money claiming this is an email from amazon costumer service this is the nd purchase for me the first one wasn labeled upgrade it lasted about months until dropped it on the floor this one the upgrade doesn work well at all the left and right click are very touchy and the scrolling drags and skips across pages the connectivity was also delayed despite trying different computers and different settings the problems persisted returned the upgrade ,1

upon opening this speaker noticed it comes in very nice box the speaker seems durable and sounds amazing when it works right only had this for days used it the st day worked great come the rd day not so much it will play but cut out intermittently during songs speaker stays on it just literally stops when it wants to and plays when it wants to figure got lemon so ll try another might suggest don bother talking with support they will drive you insane just replace and move on ,5
battery life seems to be decent have two of these and both have issues with the dpi randomly changing itself so have to click the button to change it numerous times day every now and then the one use at home doesn connect when turning on the computer have to unplug re plug the dongle do have it plugged into usb switch but seeing as it the only device that encounters this issue don believe the problem is the switch not likely to buy this again it been too frustrating ,5

dislike completely do not buy do not pass go this product is useless for its intended purpose yes want to use the light feature which requires me to plug in the usb cable which is only long same length as the audio cable that plugs into the controller unless your willing to sit with portable charger this product is of no use to me and recommend anyone that wants to use the product for its intended purpose to wait until they make the cable an adjustable length veteran nerd out ,5
i was so excited this mouse looks beautiful but it was one of the most frustrating devices have ever used when clicking to wake it up it would click on whatever may be on the screen at the moment including email or im drafts that have not yet been reviewed or perhaps written in anger and did not mean to send lol when you wanted to click on something you had to click several times overall frustrating very good return process no questions asked and quick refund that why stars ,1

i was tired of buying little cheap speakers that weren worth the money didn last very long and had terrible sound so decided to spend lot more for quality speaker got this for use by the pool it linked very easily to my phone the sound is great with plenty of bass can use it for several hours few days in row without worrying about the battery running down it seems to charge back up fairly fast too so glad spent the money on this totally pleased with my purchase ,5
my yr old loves this gaming headset purchased these after the wires in his last one tore up was over buying headsets until came across these with the thick cable cord instead of the thin plastic wire cord decided to give it try after reading several reviews glad that did the mic is clear the cord is thicker and the headset lights up blue to match my son gaming keyboard and mouse great reviews from kids and adults fast shipping and at very affordable price do not pass this up ,5
on the pricey side but well worth it for my needs it great for filling the backyard with tunes podcasts while gardening or playing with my two dogs pros loud clear sound simple operation excellent build quality available in variety of colors cons could use an eq in the app or even simple low mid hi curve control to optimize it for different listening environments can be powered on off remotely from app summary we were sufficiently impressed with the charge that we bought second unit for garage basement use ,5
overall it is good keyboard but it runs out of battery really fast my own does not hold on for more than or days would expect to hold the battery for or weeks or even months every week have to connect into the usb port to recharge when connected to usb port still have to connect the bluetooth adapter which makes me use an extra usb port why not just use the usb cabe to also communicate with the pc why do have to use both while charging the keyboard ,5
the mouse worked well for day but nowhere cursor is non responsive checked to make sure it was fully charged did some troubleshooting and moved the usb to multiple ports on the laptop nothing worked guessing just received dud or maybe the mouse just isn compatible with my laptop ve used multiple wireless mouses with this laptop this is the first time ve ever had an issue make sure you try the mouse out right away after charging upon receiving it incase it doesn work and needs to be returned ,1

this headset it looks so pretty love the color along the pink light when plugged in however bought this headset for my work from home job meaning need the mic performed mic test and discovered that the mic doesn work disabled the built in mic on my hp pc to ensure sound was coming solely from the headset mic heard low scratchy version of my voice gave stars bc music sounds great in the headphones and it feels high quality returning them bc the mic is about inches of trash ,1
this is exactly the keyboard was looking for soft keys press easily wireless and the rainbow lights are bonus got thro keyboards about every years next time will not have search for what want because will definitely be buying this one again they do not last forever and now that know exactly what works the best for me will go to this keyboard again and again for all future purchases saw alot of other cool stuff on their site so will be picking up few more items from klim soon ,5
this keyboard is deceptive it really pretty and feels good to use but in about months of use it started having response issues use it for gaming and it would randomly stop responding or lag for few seconds to minutes before recovering it does this regardless of charger status and even when plugged in used it directly next to the receiver and on different machines so it isn the bluetooth on my end or distance affecting it think either the keys lose responsivity or the bluetooth signal is losing connection ,5
this keyboard is not silent the keys do click not as loud as the other keyboards ve had but this is why bought it to be soundless know keyboards won be silent but can tell why they put that in their description when it just as loud as other keyboards also when you aren typing and the lights are showing you can hear humming sound coming from the board and it doesn go away until the lights shut off do live the lighted keyboard just wish it bit more quiet ,5
this mouse is super cute it is lightweight and the color matched perfectly to the picture got dark gray to match my macbook pro the click is silent which love the led lights are bright and colorful there is also setting where you can just have red lights but love the color changing the only downside is that this mouse does not hold charge long enough to last my entire workday ve started switching it off when am away from my desk and that help some charging is simple though ,5

this thing sucks you have to be to close to the system for comfort tried it on my ps and it doesn work at all for ps not satisfied especially with how close to have to be to use the head set in the ps because in order to turn it on it has to be plugged into the back and the cord to plug into the controller isn very long at all so my hands had to be right up in the ps and it wasn comfortable at all,5
this was gift for my boyfriend and might be stealing it from him xdit sounds really good indoors we haven tried outdoors yet the sound is clear and the bass sounds great was worried because of the comments saying that is mono trust me that is not even perceptible it sounds great we are not party persons so we have not thrown party using this speaker we connect it to the tv laptop or mobile and watch movies tv shows or listen music for these type of uses is perfect ,5
very nice keyboard for the price like the angle it not to steep so you it comfortable on your wrist for extended typing the keys have nice feel to them as you type the backlights help while typing in the evening it pretty nice keyboard for maybe someone starting to build gaming pc setup at the current price think you get good value the charging cable could be bit longer but the battery has lasted good amount of time so haven had the need to charge it too often yet ,5
very skeptical at the beginning did lots of research on competitors let be honest this is not going to replace total sound system if that what you are dreaming of but this speaker goes from room to room and outside and gives sound that is of high enough quality for you not to feel like you are missing out on something better bought this for family member first saw how good it was then bought one for myself within the same week battery life is great would definitely recommend this ,1
as with several other reviews here the one purchased lasted several months until it just stopped tracking mid swipe thought maybe it just needed recharge as that what it has done in the past when forgot to charge it overnight but no it more like it just shorted out works for swipe and click and then stops again kinda sucks because it really cool and fun mouse with the led lights and the charging vs batteries guess ll look now to see if the warranty will help girl out ,5

great mouse nothing super fancy comfortable to use the lights are pretty cool but there is an option to not have them on which is great to extend battery life holds charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plugged in if necessary plugged in to different computers and worked immediately on both seems quite reaponsive but only use it for general computer work so dont know how it would work for gaming all in all great mouse for decent price will update if anything changes,1

i am very much casual gamer but even so would not recommend this keyboard to anyone latency is awful keystrokes are either missed or repeated which means wouldn even use this for office applications yeah it is cheap guess except that you might as well set your on fire why not save little more and get something of quality that will actually hold up to the task for which you bought it also you know it mediocre junk when amazon does not even want it sent back as return ,1
i bought my first set on july and they were great broke wire and was so satisfied with the first set ordered the exact same model but on the new ones unless turn the column down really really low the sound distorts thought would like these as much as the last ones so destroyed the box wish hadn or would send this back in heartbeat if you order and get set that does not distort you will be happy with them but these that distort and not much pumpkin ,5
i bought this mouse in november and it just died april used this for working hours week and even took weeks of for maternity and wasn using this mouse so really this mouse only lasted months the usb bluetooth that plugs into the computer died the mouse will still light up when turn it off and on but then doesn do anything after that it was great mouse while it worked though guess shouldn be upset with this mouse compared to the price you get what you pay for ,5
i bought when started to play more mouse keyboard games and didn want to be tethered to the computer it pretty has nice height with the little feet but is little glitchy sometimes it might be that the charge is running out but it puts itself to sleep the lights turn off and the keys don register in bursts and have to switch back to my wired keyboard the only fix is to plug it into the computer with cord that is shorter than my existing wired keyboard cord ,1
i have had this keyboard for well over month now it is cordless and rechargeable the great thing about it is that when the battery needs charge can plug it in with the supplied usb cord and still use the keyboard while it is charging the keys are backlit with the light coming through each keys letter not just around them the lights turn off after short time of non use but light back up with the tap of any key would buy this again without hesitation if needed ,5
i have lot of back issues which causes me to be up all hours of the night so to keep my mind off of it will play on my gaming laptop and it would drive my wife nuts in the middle of the night hearing the clicking of the mouse got this yesterday and absolutely love it and so does she she cannot hear the mouse one bit and the led lighting is absolutely beautiful it goes so well with my backlight keyboard would recommend this mouse to anyone ,1
i like the design and feel of the mouse my concern is that it tends to go to sleep and anytime have not used it for few minutes have to press the button on top and then it does come right back on guess with time will learn to do that each time want to use it in use it does not function as smoothly as had hoped it would hesitating to start and then the curser hops when am trying to drag it from one place to another ,5

i loved this mouse it was so pretty and the glided really smoothly everything worked great for about month and now the mouse won turn on ve charged it fully and whenever attempt to turn the switch on it shuts right back off that being said did buy another one being under don mind having to replace it hopefully it was fluke with the first mouse and this second one will work for much longer than few weeks if the same thing happens again will not be purchasing third ,1

i no audiophile but have been amazed by the sound quality of this speaker hearing subtle sounds from my classic rock tracks that have never noticed and this compares to both bose wave and their portable brick friend has the version and think this has better sound the range is superior to any of the bluetooth speakers have used and just realized can keep the phone close because of the charging capabilities don know if these other reviewers were expecting live philharmonic sound quality because this speaker is awesome ,5
i ordered this mouse for part of my son birthday gift it arrived next day and he was very excited unfortunately he couldn click anything with it even though he could move the cursor around since he threw away the original box could not return the item so decided to contact the seller they have great customer service and she sent me the replacement right away this time the mouse works perfectly fine my son is so happy to have this cool looking mouse the price is amazing too ,5
i work from home and purchased this keyboard for my work computer prefer the backlit keys for work and usually the letters don wear off as quickly this worked great for about weeks and then it was no longer quiet keyboard my kids complain about how loud it is even rooms away and it misses keys when type or double types letter when pushed it once so if you like purchasing something that works for weeks and then sucks this is the keyboard for you otherwise keep shopping lol,5
klim is fantastic company had never heard of them before purchasing this keyboard and have no ties to them had some trouble with the dongle connecting to the keyboard out of the box klim technology support service was amazing and went above and beyond the service is friendly and fast the keyboard itself is awesome my daughter said the keyboard is so nice she just wants to type things even when her work is done great for gaming looms and feels great promote all things klim what fantastic company ,5
my old headset was going out so had to buy new one saw this in the amazon choice on sale for over half off and the reviews were good so bought it came in day sooner than expected they have great sound came in at full volume and had to lower the volume since it was so loud don use the mic because have standalone mic so can say how that works my only complaint is the ear cushions aren as comfortable as hoped they re kind of stiff ,5
new review the company contacted me directly via email they offered to replace my headset due to the issues on the previous one received the new one few weeks ago but finally got the chance to try it new headset works very good sound quality is better would recommend it previous review the only issue have with it is the sound quality have to turn up the volume all the way to be able to get decent sound noise cancellation is good might get them replaced for something else ,5
only had the item for bit over month and started having issues with the keyword would not working would plug it in to charge and it wouldworks for awhile then start having issues would not type would pull the usb connector out of my computer and put back in and it would work for short time dealt with this for couple of days but then no longer could tolerate the keyboard not working went out and bought me different keyboard work from home and have to have reliable keyboard ,5
product loos great and it feels awesome however am experiencing huge issue when it comes to the keyboard not responding to me typing have to turn the keyboard off or plug in usb cable to it and sometimes it still acts as if didn enter key this is very frustrating ve checked to see if it was device drivers anything that not updated on my system manufacturer website etc still experiencing this issue does anyone know how to resolve this if so this product would definitely receive tar rating ,1
really nice keyboard its far quiet than mechanical keyboard which is what want the finger resist is slightly higher but its fine battery lasts me about week on full brightness there is not many cons so am nick picking but every time you turn off the keyboard it forgets your settings and the actual placing of the off button is unusual so just always leave it on now its really just to stop the cat walking on it anyways highly recommend it espcially if your computer doesnt have bluetooth,5
the headphones fit comfortably the headphones are not lout though even with everything turned up they aren as loud as they could be would recommend these for kids for that alone otherwise they aren bad as replacement for bucks they also can use usb or single port the wire is split and even comes with splitter for the single port total of different ways to hook it up it is made of cheap plastic so it might be for everyone but it not bad option if you need headset ,5
the mouse does well use it daily for work it lasts long time between charges and puts itself to sleep when am not using it so battery is not wasted sometimes can go weeks without charging my only complaint is the wheel have had it about months and the wheel started squeaking recently people can hear it in my calls and it sometimes drives me nuts this is my rd wireless mouse the other were different kinds and the wheel stopped working at all was common complaint on those ,1

the wired mouse ve been using at work was driving me insane with its loud clicking noises love the convenience of this one being wireless so it easy to use with my desktop or laptop it super easy to install and while the buttons aren completely silent they are significantly more quiet than your average mouse the colorful leds are fun but it not feature ll be using lot so far ve had no issues with connectivity or responsiveness at all certainly recommend this mouse at this price point ,1

this mouse is good for its price its light and the clicking mechanism is actually quite nice when you press down it more of subtle soft click which like lot rather than an annoying and loud click however it does feel little cheap when you hold it and quality of the plastic is pretty low when using the led mode you can practically see inside the mouse once again though for it not bad like it because can connect it to my macbook air too which uses an usb ,5
very nice keyboard lots of color choices breathing speed can be adjusted from really slow to fast or you can choose to not breathe at all and keep solid color well made my only complaint is it shuts off after seconds of non use but simple touch of button immediately turns it back on again contacted customer service for some questions regarding the lighting nothing was wrong with the keyboard customer service was fantastic they responded to me immediately and answered all my questions would definitely recommend this keyboard ,5
works great just feels little flimsy so not sure how it will hold up suppose it good value for the price the slowly changing colored led lights are pretty cool like that unlike the apple magic mouse you can use this mouse while it is charging the seller extended the warranty another months after registered it so that gives me little more confidence in the quality or at least the customer service was compensated by the seller for this review with refund of the purchase price of the mouse ,5

 and differently from the alienware saved about dollars love the fact you can switch the leds off to save battery also good battery is rechargeable although in about weeks never had to charge it yet good quality and fun to use also awfully cheap which is always plus not sure if is good match for gaming ve used it in the new ms flight simulator and must say the response was fine not sure though if it would be fast enough for the kill em all gamestotally recommended ,1

all can say is that use it lot this is going to sound stupid but really don remember the last time charged it mean don use it everyday but at least to tines week for at least couple of hours sometimes bring it in my garage as am working on project so it will be on for to hours it still shows lights for charge just told the wife the other night as we were listening to it on the deck that cant believe it still has charge ,5
constant clicking sounds and static over the microphone this product is just terrible and is most likely due to the cheap mm design with no qc over it the sound quality is decent but the cheap plugs they use make it failure since you will end up with the annoying buzzing sound maybe you can get lucky and get headphone with the plugs properly fitted but chances are even little bump here or there will easily knock it off place good luck taking your chances with this product ,5
i am looking for more than decent little camping speaker haven run the battery down completely only listening to it for about hours first thing noticed listening to few different types of music is that it got little to no low end you start to lose everything at around hz not looking to blow the doors off of anything but want little more than this can give the build quality feels super sturdy and it gets pretty loud for its size it can definitely fill my studio apartment ,5
i love the colors feel of the keyboard and how quiet it is only other thing was the shortcut keys didn like not being able to change some of the shortcut keys on the board got in my way in some of my apps didn get much beyond that because the battery didn last very long had to recharge it too soon sent it back due to the battery issue other than the battery the keyboard was great give it stars but reduced to because of the battery ,5
i love this keyboard the keys are super quiet and it comfortable to type on it great having the colors as opposed to simple white backlight only have two issues first do with the colors were tad bit brighter second would like way say downloadable software to control the brightness as well as how fast the colors fade or not at all even and lastly how long before sleep mode kicks in for the price though you definitely can complain and frankly feel my issues are very minor ,5
i ordered charge while back and was very happy decided to get another one for different place in my home after seeing charge was available and at the se price point as my older charge ordered it out of the box it has the same great jbl quality was very happy to hear jbl did away with the annoying start up and shut down tones bluetooth connection is faster and the sound is fuller than the charge we get more than advertised run time very well done jbl ,5
i recently tried to go back to an old pair of headphones and found them to be lacking so opted to buy second pair of these since had used them before and enjoyed them after side by side comparison these headphones are more comfortable have much higher audio quality and overall feel like they have better build quality than other headphones ve used if you re looking for great product that looks good and for lower price than high end ones buy these you certainly won regret it ,5
i ve learned this lesson again open the package and use the product right away ordered this mouse in august as my travel mouse and just packed it away in my bag now ve been visiting family in the pnw since mid september the mouse took charge and worked fine for couple of weeks after recharged the mouse it worked for day or two and then ceased to function the optical light will flash once when turned on then nothing of course the return window is well past ,1
i was really excited about this mouse it arrived and worked perfectly for about week and now it refuses to respond have tried charging it it currently plugged into my computer as the instructions specify but it dead to the world have tried all of troubleshooting suggestions but you can troubleshoot something that won turn on for love or money so for one week was happy now just irritated and disappointed don bother spending the money no matter how awesome it seems you ll just be let down ,1
never got to actually use this for real my computer wasn built when initially bought it but it was functional at least with my laptop but soon as was ready to use it on my desktop it won work for anything the only reason am giving this more than star is the seller at least tried and replaced this receiver when thought that was the problem but unfortunately this is cheaply made keyboard and basically you get what you pay for don expect robust quality with this thing,1
nice keyboard overall the tactile feedback is pleasant although don like the placement of the key the colorful backlight is cool but some keyboard shortcuts simply do not work ctrl shift for example doesn work if you use the left ctrl shift keys that pretty outrageous since that is very common shortcut used in many apps on most operating systems it not just my keyboard this is apparently known issue with the keyboard don know how klim can sell keyboard with known defect and without warning about it ,5
since mainly draw art didn see need to have bulky gaming mouse this fits perfectly in my hand and has very quiet clicks which is ideal when drawing at night while the family is asleep the ability to switch between changing colors or just plain mouse mode is very useful for me enjoy the fact that you can turn it off with that very switch too as most mice at this price range never have that option it good buy for casual office or laid back working experience ,1

someone in my family asked for this product for christmas gift so after reading the great reviews bought it she used it for one week and it needed charged after that it wouldn hold charge for more than minutes after she told me this contacted the seller they immediately responded and offered to send me another one if was willing to send back the defective one am completely convinced that the one received just had defect they were so easy to work with and the replacement works perfectly ,5
the keyboard itself was lit up it was charged tried multiple usb ports and rebooted my computer also tried on another computer did not want to seem to connect wirelessly also in an attempt to get it to work thought that possibly wiring it to my computer using the charging usb port it might work just not wirelessly which did not then went through amazon tech and am now returning the product think ill be looking for another brand because im still in need of wireless backlit keyboard,5
the keys themselves are fairly quiet but the space bar appears to only be anchored in one spot so it clicks when you press it calling this keyboard silent is false advertising also have had the problem with using the left ctrl shift keys in keystroke sequence like when clearing cache or opening an incognito window which regularly need to do for work the right ctrl shift keystroke works though do like the battery life and the backlight but will be returning this and looking for something different ,1
the things hate about this keyboard were mentioned in the reviews but overlooked them this product is not made in the usa even though there is an american flag displayed suggesting it is the supplied cable is only feet long and does not insert fully into the keyboard so factor in the price of foot cable that does insert as had to do finally the keyboard lights time out after minute of non use even if you leave it plugged in and battery life is not an issue ,1
this is great product for cheap price it is light weight the rechargeable battery keeps charge very well only have to charge it couple times week and you can use it while it is charging sit about feet away from my pc tower or xbox and have no issues with it not responding this is also very nice looking product and looks exactly how the picture shows will buy this product in the future if need another one this also works for my xbox one which is awesome ,5
we bought this as replacement for our son for school work he had the old version and it worked really well but he dropped it one to many times and broke lasted yr this one couple weeks into school work the cursor started to drift for no reason my son is in the th grade no drops tried several differ backgrounds nothing worked so my husband tried out the mouse still does not work not upgraded waisted our money and frustrated the whole house withe the uncontrollable drift ,5
we purchased this product because we heard good things about it however the battery stopped taking charge after about months we filed warranty claim and after many emails and several hours of our time sorting things out we were told there was nothing they could do because the item was manufactured the prior year and they do not go by the date of purchase ridiculous the offered coupon to buy something else from them but obviously we will not be buying their products in the future very disappointed ,5
when received there was mystery liquid on the number pad chose to assume maybe it was cleaning fluid of some sort wiped it off and moved on with my life its supposedly water proof per advertisement right keyboard works fine while plugged in and has quiet keys but will not hold charge advertised as bluetooth and has bluetooth connector but only working as wired keyboard at this point and the backlight is super dim even at the highest brightness maybe mine was faulty but personally do not recommend ,1
worked good for the first months used the mouse on security camera hard drive to review camera footage worked fine one time and after that no cursor icon appeared tried plugging it back into my desktop and still no cursor icon available it won select anything only right click works but can scroll to selection luckily my desktop is touch screen so manually opened up the drives properties and it said that all device functions are working properly clearly not being able to see cursor is an issue ,1

 this was pretty good buy and it actually better than thought it pretty quiet when typing and very smooth love how it goes to sleep mode after few seconds the lights on the keyboard are nice and vibrant much better than thought it would be comes with usb to cord for lightning fast charging only charged it once on friday and it still going we ll see how long the keyboard power will last will definitely keep you guys posted other than that no complaints so far ,1
i admit that might have overused it since bought it for my work from home but my sis got similar one which is why bought this one and that one actually lasts days without the need of chargei needed to charge this one multiple times on the day and at one point it just wouldn work even while plugged in so still needed to switch to the old oneit is really disappointing idk if got faulty product or if that is actually the extent of its productivity,5

i am updating my review of this headset received an updated gaming headset from the vendor the issues that had had have been corrected with the new headset am extremely pleased with my new product the company has done an outstanding job to solve my initial issue please ignore my previous review that is below one of the issues is that the headphones were sized for young kid and expanding them did not help that much the sound quality was fine but noise cancellation was not adequate ,5
i bought this after my xiberia headset broke and was blown away by how much of downgrade it was might actually tape up the xiberia to use it instead of this the sound quality on these is bad there are weird whining noises in the earpiece whenever people talk to me it has separate usb port which thought would be nice but its only purpose is to turn on the lights no joke this is waste of spend bit more and get pair of xiberias here instead ,5
i bought this keyboard so could see the keys as write in the evening and at night this lightweight soft keys keyboard has great backlighting with multiple colors that flash the light gently in the background as you type when the keys are not in use the backlighting turns black off therefore sparing the user the time it would need to charge it there is also an on off button that is optional as well am able to use this keyboard swiftly and quietly with no problem ,5
i bought this yesterday to replace broken mouse day has incredibly noticeable lag fully charged it before using it it runs about the same as turtle stuck in syrup this isn worth just buy different mouse update the brand behind this sent me an email from shady address claiming to be amazon custom service and offered me to delete the review not chance urge you to stay away from this brand they re shady af they ll try to scam you after you buy their scummy product ,1

i honestly love this product the keys are very comfortable to use and the ergonomics of the keyboard are conducive for gaming and typing my keyboard did experience some issues with the left side shift key after about years of heavy use so reached out to customer support and was mailed replacement in about days after contacting them the customer support team is extremely friendly and helpful overall this is an excellent product and excellent company will absolutely purchase any pc hardware from klim in the future ,5
i ordered this headset back in november and the microphone stopped working in february it was christmas gift for my son and he was only able to use it from january february the headset stopped after only days couldn return it because it was past the return window so ordered another one last week it arrived on and again it defective and the microphone doesn work this is incredibly frustrating that ve had the same problem twice with product that is considered best seller with positive reviews ,5
i purchased two of these one works of the time get some ghost keys and missed keys but it is something can live with this second keyboard though wow just wow maybe half the keys work at most charged it up tried multiple computers oses etc same result get maybe half the keys working it is very random too as to when it happens and which keys spend little extra and get something that is actually worth it and if you are worried about accuracy buy wired ,5
i returned the jbl charge for two reason first to my ears the sound has too much bottom music sounds muddy and the higher end is lost due to too much bass unfortunately there no way to adjust the bass and treble what you hear is what you re stuck with the second reason for my return is the awful electronic sound effects that play automatically when you turn the device on or off regardless of your streaming volume these sound effects are loud and completely unnecessary ,1
i was happy to get the gift from my sister sound quality was great when tried it out before putting it to full use on my patio wanted to fully charge the speaker guess what no usb charging cord in the packaging nor any set up documentation found some on line but it was quickly apparent that my usb cords for my iphone would not work to charge the device had to order what hopefully will fit replacement from amazon extremely disappointed with bothamazon and the seller ,5
it cool mouse the led features are nice and it pretty but hate when have to move it sporadically for good seconds before the mouse moves on the screen ve tried different mouse pads and it still happens it extremely frustrating and it happens as soon as you stop using for any period of time and go back to using it you have to left and right click numerous times before it will respond now it also makes an irritating high pitched noise when you move it ,5

it very small really enjoyed the sleek design of it but think ll have to give this to my kid yeah the padding is soft but very firm maybe my ears are too big cause it hurts to wear after long period of time max hours the microphone isn great for what wanted just too soft spoken of person for this to work for me probably cause the mic is stiff and can get it any closer to my face this purchase was learning experience for me ,5
jbl has always put out fabulous sounding speakers bought two one on each side of the room on shelf and they sound awesome unbelievable quality for such small speaker would recommend to anyone shopping around for good sounding portable speaker to purchase at least two more if you like of these it took me moment or two to figure out the jbl connect app but once got through it wasn super hard the speakers and app take care of connectivity themselves all have to do is jam ,5
jbl uses non standard charging port if you misplace your cord none of the hundreds of other charging cords you have laying around will work knew about this and no surprise still managed to misplace it my tone is polite but actually seething about this tired old engineered money grab tactic thousands on thousands of other manufacturers chose standard readily available port and cord to hell with you for not doing the same at this stage in the game it just good sense and basic common courtesy ,5
klim chroma rechargeable keyboard is great don use it for gaming so cannot address that but for regular typing and daily usage it can be beat had defective key and contacted klim their customer care was superior and they truly value their customers replacement was promptly sent after few questions highly recommend klim for not only their products but for company that stands behind their products and that values their customers have purchased two klim keyboards and would do so again if needed to purchase another one ,5
my husband had the prior version and we loved it so much so that purchased this with the case to link to his we use them everywhere and lot charge life is excellent even better than my husband individual and linked stereo sound fantastic portability at the beach by the pool and around the property when we re doing projects and chores great and convenient ease of use for technical illiterate such as myself ranks so after an entire summer of almost daily use giving this solid ,5
overall the headset works really well it is really easy to set up and the sound is awesome the ear muffs make it easy to put on due to their large size my last headset would make my ears hurt this one has an easy mute button and the cord is made out of material that would make it last long time you really do not have to worry about it breaking and in the off chance it does the company provides great warranty for their products ,5
the headphones were nice do appreciate the the fact it has mic attached and they are pretty comfy on my head and its fits tightly on my head so don have to worry about it falling off or anything so it good for gaming when you need to focus its one of those headphones that has two cords for phone and pc plugins which is slightly annoying since don have pc but since it does have one its good for those that have and play pc games,5
the item is actually nice the size color and lights are very cute and love that is rechargeable the only issue encounter was that when you leave it idle for few seconds and then try to use it it gets super slow and lags have to turn it off and back on to have the speed back to normal don know if that is feature to save power or if mine is defective ll try to reach out to the seller has anyone else experienced this issue ,1

this speaker sounded awesome until it didn started turning off on its own spent tons of hours troubleshooting called the company and they couldn even find my device by serial number they were completely useless offered me off coupon to buy another piece of crap speaker this speaker was gift will never purchase jbl product there are too many other products on the market to deal with defective equipment and piss poor service don believe me google reviews for jbl pulse tons of issues buy another brand ,5
this speaker sounds better than my surround sound it has very long battery life use mine few times week and it sounds great no matter how loud have it my iphone connects faster to the bluetooth in this speaker than in my car and have car so it pretty up to date say would buy another one but one is plenty for my needs also it such good quality that don think ll need to buy another one anytime soon however will recommend this speaker to everyone ,1
tried to use this on work call with my laptop and on xbox for game session no one could hear me the mic has very low sound pick up also the microphone sits differently to the picture the picture makes it look close to the face mouth but when pulled into position you can not get it close to the side of your face let alone level with your mouth for sound the positive is that the lights are nice and they are comfortable on the ears ,5
when this gets low on battery it starts to flicker out where the mouse will stop and start sending information so your clicks won register and the mouse will stop moving across the screen the added problem is that it gets to this low battery point after about min to an hour of use and then it acts like that for the next several hours it nearly impossible to keep it charged up that long it shame because love how stylized it is but it basically unusable ,5

 at first really liked this mouse it was lightweight and had sleek design it ended there every time go to use the mouse throughout the day have to return it on even when it already in the on position anyone that is used to any other type of wireless mouse and you just use it anytime will quickly become annoyed with this mouse the fact that you have to flip the switch on and off every time you go to use it makes it poor choice ,5

for you are better off getting wired mouse this thing is so bad the sensor light bleeds through the top shell of the mouse worse is that the actual functionality is very poor if your are looking for an accurate mouse this is not it have multi colored mouse pad and the sensor struggles between the change in shades making this mouse difficult to use if you have plain color mouse pad this may be acceptable but if your on the go this will not do ,5

honestly couldn be happier with it hadn heard of the company before but the receipt of this keyboard made me an instant fan quality product at fair price and they seem to be sincere in putting customer service first and it came with metal stickers one immediately went on my pc will buy more of their products update after couple of years the charging port broke but the keyboard was still under warranty and they sent me brand new one absolutely wonderful customer service still experience ,5
i bought this for my daughter and initially she said she loved it then she stopped using it and went back to her old mouse left my mouse at work and borrowed this one now know why she doesn use it it constantly disconnects and have to turn it on and off to get it to work then it randomly tracks on the screen when am not moving it it seems like someone else is controlling my computer unsettling this mouse is junk very pretty junk ,5
i bought this for the office to have as something different love that the keyboard and mouse are rechargable totally what sold me on it but would be nice the lights would stay on longer before timing out and if there were more options for the light like maybe blinking or running back and forth or even blink multi color or even different solid colors to pick from along with the different light options blink flash fade etc other than that overall good product thank you,5
i bought this keyboard to replace my old one because my daughter spilt her drink on it this keyboard has worked out perfectly it keeps long charge and is easy to move around have my home office set up at the kitchen table my daughter also uses it for school love that it is not too bright but lights up just enough to see the keys when needed would recommend this to anyone with kids and those who needs to move around their work area frequently ,1
i had never heard of this brand and was little concerned might be buying some weird off brand that was of poor quality so glad that not the case this keyboard is all quality they keys feel amazing to type on the lighting comes with few options like adjusting brightness and the whole thing feels sturdy set up was easy of course was reading through the few inserts that come in the packaging and there even cute description of how the keyboard was shipped to me ,5
i love this thing the sound quality is good for the size and it very portable obviously you can just max the volume on it and your phone it gets distorted like anything else for the price pay this is absolutely worth it use this mainly in the bathroom while showering since it beats phone music out of the water even carry it to the garage and place it and jam out while working on my car considering getting another one of these for family member ,1
i used these headphones mainly for gaming on my playstation but they worked just as good on my pc ve bought more expensive gaming headphones and these can compete with those except for the noise canceling but it not bad the long chord gives you room for gaming from distance and the volume control on the chord is nicely placed the led lights looks pretty nice and the fact you have an option to use them or not but still use the headphones is nice addition ,1
i ve had these for quite some time now and they ve stood up against use by myself in my year old and year old my only problem is that they do not work on my ps however they work fine for my xbox one with no need to buy anything extra not sure exactly what missing for them to not be working other than that which is disappointing considering wanted one pair for all my systems they work nicely for the price and look good ,5
i was little worried about battery life based on some of the other reviews am not gamer have an office job but on my computer probably hours day and used my mouse extensively single charge lasts me days you can also use the mouse when you are charging have usb port on my keyboard that use per my attached picture as you can see the charging cable is pretty short so some might need to extend the cord but overall am very happy with this mouse ,1

just like the head states the windows key no longer functions also don particularly appreciate that the lights on the keyboard do not stay illuminated for more than few seconds work on three monitors and need functioning windows key to move you guessed it my windows around using the shortcut windows shift arrow key figured it was my pc so changed to different pc in the house had the same issue then went back to my wired keyboard no problems another keyboard for the junk pile ,1
ok so there is nothing wrong with this keyboard but nowhere in the description did it say that it had matte finish the keys have slightly sandpaper feel to them that just cannot handle as highly sensory sensitive person every time touch key it is like nails on chalkboard it was great price so decided to use it as keyboard for my tv used very infrequently instead of my primary computer keyboard rather than return it am now shopping for an alternative primary keyboard to use ,5
the first day received the product it worked very well though couldn get seem to get it to charge it had enough juice to get through the first day so wasn too concerned by the second day though something had happened to the optical portion because moving the mouse often wouldn move the cursor and never moved it as fast as it should the buttons all seem to work fine still but without the ability to actually move the mouse as want to it pretty useless ,1

the mouse is colorful addition to my desk and unlike other computer mice have owned it does not have thumb operated controls on its left side where left handed person like myself would unintentionally press button and start function they didn want to activate ve only had it for about week so it remains to be seen how frequently it needs to be recharged the light display draws significant amount of power so need to remember to turn the mouse off whenever shut down the pc ,1

the mouse itself is beautiful the lights make it better rating this because it worked good for the first few days but after that noticed that it randomly stops working even after it fully charged have to move the switch to off and back on for it to work sometimes it still lags or cuts off and literally have to keep it on charge for it to work continuously don think it going into sleep mode because it does it sometimes while actively using the mouse ,1
they work as intended but sometimes they re weird you do get what you pay for the cord is obnoxiously long the microphone only works if have the switch perfectly in between the muted and not muted setting very odd the headset covers your whole ear so it doesn put pressure on them which is nice the headset itself is pretty big and clunky though definitely good purchase if you re casual gamer who just needs cheap headset had it for couple years and it works ,1
wanted this for living room computer put the wifi reciever into usb port in back of the pc by my tv and if use the charging cable that came with it got further away than using the wifi component it seems which means you get between ft of range for anything other than using it across room it does seem responsive easy to use and other wise great keyboard but if you want to sit more than ft from your computer you may want something else ,1
 bought this mouse read direction simple and easy plug in to phone charger for hrs then unplug mouse will turn blue say it need to be charged hrs then it will turn red then go to mouse plug in the usb port in to windows computer then turn button on mouse underneath to on then try mouse out to see if it moves on computer give this out of stars dont give in to bad reviws people post bad reviews and never reads instruction first,1
cool little speaker but jbl straight up lies when they say it connects to your other jbl speakers they advertise that it connects to up to other jbl speakers but it isn true have another jbl which is why purchased this one it does not connect to my other jbl speaker called customer service and they confirm that it will not connect to my other jbl speaker it is complete bait and switch poor customer service and straight up lies on the part of jbl ,5
definitely steal at dollars love black friday specials the jbl charge is just the right size to get good audio and still be able to take it on the go have the flip the extreme and now the charge and this charge is my favorite this speaker has pretty long lasting battery while not being huge and unpractical it has power bank feature but to be honest never use it the sound quality is amazing this one has lot more bass compare to the flip ,5
great speaker and great seller only con have found with this speaker is only having driver speaker it looses the stereo effect of the charge which has two very slightly smaller speakers the low tones are better and deeper the charge but it looses alot of high tones the charge picks them up great ll be ordering in near future to link with the for full rounded sound but the bass is lot better with the still really good sound and great volume eith the ,1
i bought the jbl charge in the summer of months later and now it won take charge and shuts off within about minute of turning it on while plugged in so it is completely unusable assume that maybe just bought lemon but this has been problem for all the jbl speakers ve bought ve owned the jbl earbuds jbl clip and jbl clip my jbl clip is the only one still working going to try another brand because tired of having to throw away speakers ,1
i bought this keyboard because it was one of the cheaper ones with decent reviews and have to admit for the first month or so it was great but now it doesn connect well wirelessly and it hassle to try and get it to register the keys pressing which is frustrating when first got it there were no issues and it was comfortable enough to use like most standard keyboards and the rgbs are nice but the sleep mode gets tad bit annoying after while ,5
i have two problems no matter how long you charge it for it dead in an hour that if it been works the usb plug in takes two people to get out and afraid it will get stuck and ruin my computer the appearance is great but it doesn work and could break the usb port because of this do not recommend since this posted the company offered to change review instead of just sending another mouse clearly they know there product does not work ,5

i just used this mouse for work few hours day and it inexplicably stopped turning on when flipped the switch after just days plugged it in to charge like done few times before and the blue light came on when the blue light went off unplugged it and switched it on but it flashed red couple of times and wouldn work repeated the process with the same outcome know it cheap mouse but wow got less than one day of use for every dollar spent ,1

i like that it sounds noise cancellation really good what don like is that it heavy and too small tight for my big year old head cm or inches in circumferences gaming for long time like hours make you really dizzy aftereffect are bad headaches nausea and disorientation due to uncomfortable so don really recommends this for adults or kids with big head would like if this headphone extends bit more maybe like inch it would make the grip less so it won be uncomfortable ,1
i picked this up because was looking for quiet wireless keyboard the reviews and product information said this was the one for me but it disappointing the keys are quiet but the space bar is so loud and rickety that it more than makes up for the quiet keys and since using this to type all day and not game the space bar gets hit lot ll deal with it and the other features of the keyboard are fine but this is disappointment to me ,1
i ve been using mechanical boards for while and randomly used non mechanical one that found in my closet and realized like it way more so went to amazon to find better quality non mechanical board and found the corsair which was but then saw this board for only so tried this one out no complains whatsoever yet typing feels great fast response time very lightweight and wireless has been flawless update been using this now for years still has no issues and works great,1
i ve enjoyed using this keyboard but one big problem seem to be running into is the battery life have other wireless keyboards that will last week before have to recharge them using this one for about the same about of time have been having to recharge it multiple times week not sure if the backlight is draining the battery that much but that seems like major difference some of the keys sometimes stick or don seem to respond unless you press them very hard ,5
my boyfriend got me this as gift to help with my crafting love this color because it goes with my cricut also loved that it came with an adapter for my macbook air these newer macbooks require adapters for anything that is not charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is amazing don have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use love it thank you so much for thinking of us apple users ,1

ordered this and received on while the audio quality wasn high end by any stretch husband was happy with the way these felt and sounded in terms of my usage he used them for gaming and online chat but the microphone on off switch has broken after days of use rendering this headset completely useless for its intended purpose my husband has resorted to taping and gluing up the headset which was broken and unwearable because that headset still works this one not so much ,1
the aux input doesn work properly the sound keeps cutting out this is simply bad design and when contacted jbl support about this here was their official response our jbl charge normally goes on standby when there is no sound coming out of the speaker for while this feature can be turned off they called their poor design feature much in the same way faulty brakes on car is feature they also solicited me for star review and incentivized me with gift card so stars ,5
the keys are very buggy in response takes hitting the keys several times in some instances for them to work keyboard goes into sleep mode seconds after you hit key so it is constantly turning off forcing you to jam the keys to get them to work again it is pretty and the company sends you cute emails after you buy it but just garbage product overall have had to buy new keyboard just days after purchasing this one as it id border line unusable,5
the sound is crystal clear and the wire prevents easy entanglement but ve noticed something after couple of weeks of use the ear pieces aren comfortable for adults due to them being too small and what even worse is that wear glasses and it makes it even more uncomfortable for me and even making it difficult to focus during gaming have to constantly try to move them around just for it to be bearable in comfort so warning not recommended with glasses and or adults ,1
this is an excellent keyboard and exactly what was looking for the keys are extremely responsive and like the low profile of the keyboard also the keys are extremely quiet and the different color lighting is cool easy function button combinations controls functions such as turning the color lighting off or adjusting the dimness brightness of the lighting the packaging is great and liked the message the company provides in black envelope along with the stickers this product works great with kvm switch highly recommend ,1
this product is good for its price the set up was very quick for tech savvy like myself it was easy to figure out its settings and such however when was trying out keyboards shortcuts such as ctrl or ctrl on windows cmd or cmd for macos it wasn working with this keyboard you have to click windows button fn or whatever shortcut you have to pressed to enable its function it took me awhile by pressing random buttons haha hope this helps other consumers ,5
when bought this headset the mic is very bad and when talked in it my friends could barely hear me would have to scream into the mic for them to hear me also in order for the led lights to work you have to have pc also it says there noise cancelation and when tried could hear everything my friend said behind me and he was whispering the sound quality is ok but not good enough for almost the bass sucks too would not recommend ,5
when seller states in the first bullet that the headset is compatible with laptops and it is not that really bothers me my son is happy because he has new headset to use with his gaming console however am out of pocket and have to spend more money to look for something that is compatible with laptop it is disappointing do not buy for use with laptop because it does not work like they claim even with the adapter that is included in the packaging ,5
 feels good in my hand and works well the roller wheel works as third button which is important for my work colors are pretty and you can turn the lights off so that bonus it charges so no batteries and loving that the only issue finding is that it goes to sleep very fast if you wait to long to move it you have to click the power like next to the roller wheel not big deal just annoying sometimes overall happy with it ,1

 the wireless mouse was great in the beginning weeks later it wouldn keep charge when it did charge it would only work if it was hooked up to the charger on my laptop meaning still couldn use it then would unplug it and lights started going crazy so would turn the switch off and on to try and use it epic fail waste of my hard working money then they only give you certain amount of time to return so basically it total loss ,1

battery life is great being able to use it as charger for other devices like to charge cell phone also major plus but where it suffers is the sound quality as others have mentioned the mono speaker is definitely weak point though the bass output is decent for its size the speaker barely seems to get as loud as our flip also when connected via bluetooth to our samsung tv for is quite noticeable lag in audio once again in comparison to the flip ,5
can just say wow this mouse is absolutely incredible the wireless feature and led lights make this thing steal for its price it is super helpful when want to stay in bed but still use my pc from afar can just pull this bad boy out and start going it has silent clicks to it as well so you wont be waking or bothering anybody buy using this mouse and with its low profile shape and structure it takes up practically no room whatsoever ,5

everything about rhis speaker love you get what you pay for is true here bought few different ones and borrows few friends speakers and compared them all and this one is well worth the cost the volume and sound range and clarity was noticeably better with this speaker compared to all the others the battery life is great ve had it at of max volume for about hours and it shows of leds lit highly recommend this to anyone looking for powerful portable speaker,5
i bought this because trying to minimize the amount of wires on my desk and because the color matches my pc case but it not worth it the mouse barely works and it takes forever to get it to actually click on what you want like it pretty and the colors are cute but those are the only good things about this thankfully play with controller so it doesn hinder my gaming but if you do play mouse and keyboard absolutely don get this ,1

i bought this specifically because it said it was quiet keyboard not even close it is no more quiet than normal keyboard false advertising and false description of the product have quiet hp keyboard and thought this one would be like that one because of the description this one went back in the box and ordered another hp wireless elite keyboard wish had just ordered another hp in the first place but got fooled by the false description in the headline of this keyboard ,5
i find the jbl charge to be exceptional in all respects and recommend it highly am somewhat baffled however by the wild jump in price surrounding my purchase bought it for it was not on sale three days later the price had jumped to don think the original price was mistake because that was the price for the product in all the different colors offered jump in price seems extraordinary is it worth in my opinion probably but that is for you to decide ,5
i gave this to my sweetie for christmas two days ago got call from him today telling me in detail how he had set it up and used his additional jbl bluetooth speaker with it as well he can be quite the critic being an manager but he could only say wonderful things about how easy it was operate and the quality of sound that was achieved with one small speaker thank you jbl for making my gift to my guy very special one ,5
i like that this mouse os sleek in design has long battery life and is easy to set up often forget to turn it off but that doesn matter because it goes into sleep mode to preserve battery the only concern my tablet has type so the converter is helpful the only thing that would change is that the converter doesn fit inside the mouse for storage so you have to be careful not to lose it if you detach it from the tablet ,1

i like to keep office lights turned down depending on task at hand and appreciate the illuminated keys this is just for my personal office use would actually prefer the option to use battery power but charging by usb now and then is fine personally was looking for keyboard with larger letters as my eyesight has gotten worse but sny option saw was wired not offered as wireless would also have preferred all one color but for my personal use this is rather pretty ,5
it was so pretty for the first few hours after charging with the changing lights and standby light mode then the next morning after turning it off it would not turn back on so put it on the charging cord for days and nope nothing save your money and purchase something else and make sure it takes batteries this is garbage that has pretty face on it if still had the box it came in would be getting full refund and send it back ,5
loved this at first however battery is pretty much shot am only using it with home entertainment system computer so it isn getting used lot however in less than months new need to charge it daily or at least every other day not sure the sleep function is working may try turning it off after every use to charge it less often but that will become annoying super fast even if it does work it will likely end up in the trash before long ,1
microphone doesn work at all doesn even show up in my ability to locate and change settings on devices to use the microphone as well as the switch to mute the mic doesn work because my computer can only use the mic from the computer this headset is real let down just go back to using my bluetooth headset that more comfortable and can walk around in but without mic on it if required to be at the computer to use the mic anyway ,5
my husband enjoys movies however his taste and my taste aren the same since getting these headphones we can be in the same room with him enjoying movie on his laptop while watching movie on tv my husband says the sound quality of these headphones is good as far as noise cancelling he says that some background noise does creep in but not enough to interfere with whatever movie he watching pleased with these headphones and will probably buy another pair for my grandson ,5
my kkim keyboard was about two years old and it suddenly wouldn work contact klim via email seeking tech assistance and they promptly replied and offered several suggestions to potentially solve the pry unfortunately none of these worked and they informed me that they would ship me new keyboard it arrived in two days and it has been working perfectly since received klim service and commitment was outstanding and will use their products whenever my needs can be met with suitable klim product roark,5
so have had this mouse for about weeks and it works perfectly never encountered the problems people had with it stopping and people say that the battery dies too quickly which have been using on the same battery without charging it for days my cursor has also never messed up it works just fine the only problem have with this device is the lighting is not nearly as impressive as thought it would be but guess that what you get for buying mouse for ,1

someone gave me charge bought charge thinking could pair them nope so bought another charge pairing is difficult if you desire stereo sound as opposed to two mono speakers had to get second jbl app and attempt to import my music into it some of which won play when do get it to play in stereo it doesn stay that way for long the hardware software combo has been finicky and temperamental for me also amazon is not letting me add an informative photo ,5
the back light is very nice some of the top keys don have the clearest numbering lettering but if you know where the keys are this is very minor wish the back light had an adjustable sleep timer one charge lasts long time and you can still use the keyboard while it plugged in for charging the charging cable isn very long but can easily be combined with usb extension cord the ergonomic design and curved keys offer comfort during many hours of use ,1
the bluetooth receiver works well can put it in the back of my computer and not have an issue with connection much quieter than my previous click clack old keyboard but it not silent it gets louder the more quickly you type as well but if you take your time it can be decently quiet no extra buttons need to press fn to use the secondary key commands but works well for my purposes just leave the lights on unless guests come over lol ,5
the sound it good and people can hear me on video calls what don like is the fit on my head have big head and when pull it open to put on stretch just little feel like the plastic is about to break also the hard plasic isn great fit and feels kind of odd probably should have returned them but needed them for work so kept them people can hear me and can deal with it since am not on calls all day ,5
this speaker is service members dream its tatical which basically boils down to the colors match army gear this is win win for soldiers and nice thoughtful consideration that jbl made when releasing it in sand when times get sucky and everyone is feeling homesick some good tunes from this bring morale up happy to say it fits in my gear and carry it as an accountable item at all times durability seems high have had for months now and hopefully for much longer ,1
this speaker is the best ever had the smaller version of this speaker prior and the battery life was basically nonexistent even with full charge so needed to upgrade decided to go with this speaker and so happy did the batter life lasts forever literarily never charge it or very rarely do and have yet to have it die on me the sound quality is outstanding it gets super loud without compromising quality and you can even charge your phone with it amazing speaker ,1
udpate you can use control shift together on the left side of the keyboard quick tab opens window movement what an abusrd error do yourself favor and buy different keyboard this keyboard hits all the nails except for the spacebar it seems to be made of an entirely different plastic than the rest of the keyboard and is distractingly loud if you re working in an office environment it likely you ll get looks from your co workers it ruins the entire keyboard experience ,1
update changed my review from five stars to stars it stills holds charge but the num lock keeps turning off and when hit it it makes me push the key about four times before it turns on again and now it has huge lag have only had it couple weeks and it is starting to take crap holds charge can shut it off at night and can also plug it in my computer to charge and still use it love it super quiet keys ,5
a bunch of the lights are out so that kinda annoying could tell the box had been opened and it was probably return it not super ergonomic at least for people who would wear med large size medical gloves it does what it supposed to do but gonna get different one for my work computer and use this one for my personal computer that use maybe once month it doesn feel very good in my hand to use all day at my desk ,1

best portable speaker ve owned out of purposely tested the waterproofing in snow sleet storm overnight months later it works like new still use it at work the beach the backyard and anywhere don use my headphones really the sound carries very well in open areas the bass carries alright but it still has it limits as portable the battery life is at least hrs of nearly consistent music and think maybe half phone charge as well everybody that sees it wants one ,5
bought this around months ago the advertised range of feet is just not true have the dongle around feet away and the keyboard randomly stops registering keystrokes have to bring the keyboard close to the dongle for it to re register and then sit back down on the couch this might be battery related but then there is no visual indicator of battery levels today though it just completely stopped working doesnt register any keystrokes the keyboard is very light which is nice ,5
ctrl shift left doesn work have to use ctrl shift right it is not the end of the world but it is annoying depending on the game you ll play some key combinations may not work also tried to use this for flight simulations which needs lots of key combinations failed even within less than ft from directly visible usb dongle this product misses characters while typing sleep mode and battery life is good but overall regretting my decision to buy this product ,5

headphones were great for my son the ear cushions were comfortable and overall the headphones fit great the other ones he had started to be too small for him he loved the lights and to be able to mute the mic from the headphones on the downside they only lasted him months at first the mic kept going in and out them the sound started acting up now have to get replacement at least these headphones didn physically fall apart like others have ,5
i am not using the keyboard for gaming use it for everyday use of my personal computer love how it lights up so can see the keys without turning on the light in my office as an option the keys fell easy to press down on and it just feels comfortable to use after years also had an issue with one of the keys cracking and was very pleased that klim replaced the keyboard per their warranty thank you very much to them ,5
i am so happy with it it fits well in my hand it goes in to sleep mode so it saves power and that is amazing cus fall asleep lot when am on my laptop am college student and it is amazing for it its small and really smooth the light feature is amazing when it is off that when use it it still has rad light emit when using it and love it sooo much am definitely in love with the product ,5

i got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap it really feels like its made of trash it does seem to work well enough though the tracking is inconsistent at best the ergonomics are really non existent doesn seem like it made for human hands overall if you re buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it but if you actually care about having half decent mouse skip this one ,1

i happy with my purchase it wasn an expensive mouse it wireless and rechargeable all things was looking for it is slim mouse which took some time for me to get used to only use it for office work tasks so can speak to other uses however don notice any lags delays or other issues do wish there was some way to control the colors but it not big deal also the top clear button clicks but haven figured out what that does ,5

i have tried charging this mouse with the original cables it came with did not charge then tried multiple cables and power sources already owned still did not charge left it plugged in for hours while was away from home come home to an uncharged mouse the blue light stays on for about seconds before shutting off the design and price were what attracted me to choosing this specific mouse would recommend spending bit more on quality mouse that can serve its purpose ,1

i have two jbl charge had for year or more wanted to add more speakers as can hook up to jbl speakers the best feature you can have for portable bluetooth speakers well the newer charge speakers bought just now cannot communicate with the connect firmware software of my charge showstopper for me guess could go back and get some charge of just look around for others if missed the asterisk that said the and don work together am sorry for this review ,5
i have two pairs of these depending on where am working that day wear them at my desk all day long and use them for conference calls watching videos or listening to music sound quality is great they fit great and have all day long comfort at one point one of the two broke the day after first used them reached out to the company directly they were very responsive and sent me new pair immediately with no hassle would highly recommend these ,5
i love the rotating colors on the mouse but it doesn run by batteries this seems pretty cool at first because you save money on having to buy double but then you have to think about remembering to charge it if you ve been using it all day non stop it starts to die by the night time other than that think it super cute and it pretty good and accurate with pointing even on shiny surfaces didn have much of an issue ,5

i love this headset it very good for music and gaming even if it only seems to support standard sony controllers so couldn use my custom controller with it but it no big deal it still lets you hear things you just couldn use the mic since you didn come through but the sound quality was really good and crisp especially when it comes down to bass it was perfect tldr great as long as you have sony brand controller and nothing aftermarket ,5
i ordered this keyboard and used it for about weeks and then it just stops working would charge it for hours and it just won turn on it would turn on for like minutes and then immediately shuts off then emailed amazon and got replacement the replacement stopped working days in and it is the same issue it just somehow turns off and then would charge it and it just won stay on for more than mins returning both now and thats it ,5
i purchased this keyboard because it was wireless and it claimed it would be great for gaming with fast response time that my friends is joke when can actually get the keyboard to turn on it takes several moments for it to reconnect it goes into sleep mode all the time and getting they keys to respond is extremely hard do not in any way recommend this keyboard it also says feet your lucky to get feet before you start having connectivity issues ,5
i really like this mouse for work use mine all day charge it on wednesday mid week and leave it charging friday over the weekend works completely fine coming back and buying two more had to come buy more because dropped mine and it cracked open that the only reason why not because it stopped working but because broke mine so this time in also getting backup my work laptop is mac and rather much buy this mouse than the expensive apple one ,5

i really like this wireless mouse love the changing colors and the rose gold is gorgeous my only complaint is the the usb to connect to your laptop is very hard to get out always need some sort of tool to get it out ergonomically since this review had me rate it it perhaps little too slim but don game and light laptop user so doesn bother me that much otherwise would buy again and put up with the pesky usb when travel ,1
i really wanted to like this keyboard still do sort of lol the thin form factor lighting and silent keys are really great loved typing on it however after about week of light use and weeks of moderate use for work had to stop using it it would miss key strokes double them up or triple them keys would lag behind it was agonizing to use the battery seemed ok was going to buy the wired version but think ll just move on ,5
i really wanted to love this headset it looks nice and is very lightweight but no matter what did they sound quality was incredibly poor wanted to be able to chat with friends online while gaming and even with my output volume all the way up and friends turning me all the way up in their settings they could barely hear me could barely hear them or any of the sound coming from my pc ended up replacing them within week of purchase ,5
i use this with my desk top mac like it way better than the glass apple mouse can actually utilize more features with it too on the right click glides easy and have had no problems with it which is more than can say for the apple mouse years with apple products which love but their mouse is crappy design looks good but who cares this one is reasonably priced great price actually for what you get give this mouse two thumbs up ,5
i ve bought this keyboard twice now it works great for few months honestly it is my favorite keyboard ve used so when my first one went out after about months bought another unfortunately that one lasted four months and konked out as well it just does this thing where it flickers on for second then turns right off would love to buy another one but don know if can justify buying keyboard that now assume will have to repurchase in another months ,5
i was debating between this speaker and the ultimate ears megaboom my friend actually bought the ue megaboom at the same time bought the jbl charge can say this speaker has more bass and is louder in volume prefer the directional speakers on this there is front where sound is clearer and louder and back don love how there isn strap or loop or something to grip but did buy really cool silicone case for that has strap and doesn alter the sound ,1
i was wary of buying no name brand mouse but it turned out to be even better than expected it super sleek and looks great with the leds it also functions very well the clicks are almost silent if you ve used cheap mouse that has loud clicks you ll know what talking about haha and it very reactive use it for light gaming and it perfect haven even had to charge it yet which is amazing absolutely worth it for the price ,5

its pretty it ergonomic its rechargeable no batteries but and its big but the charge wears off in about day and it takes to hours to recharge and you have to keep track of the charging cord the charge dissipates without warning this is very annoying glad kept my old mouse not sure keeping this perhaps its matter of habitually charging it overnight like phone guess glad not gamer having it quit on me at crucial time in the game would be disaster ,5
out of the box couldn get this mouse to connect with my macbook pro gave up after min of trying then tried again in couple days now it does connect but its unusable the mouse moves mm on my screen for huge amount of movement and yes checked the tracking speed in my settings clicking on anything takes about tries and scrolling is impossible upset by the deceitful overall rating of this mouse swear there are bots falsely giving this mouse good ratings ,5
purchased these headphones and after month the sound started going in and out because the wire shorted they worked fine before that but you get what you pay forupdate bengoo reached out and made things right by sending me new headset so far this one is working fine and appreciate their integrityupdate the new headset that was sent to me shorted again the audio keeps going in and out was hoping this was just fluke but this products wire is just not good,1
the keyboard is great work from home in my son bedroom so in the mornings and during nap time work in complete darkness the keyboards brightness is perfect as don have to adjust the monitor brightness too high the fact that it is rechargeable with type makes it ideal as can charge my phone as well so far ve gone days without having to charge the keyboard am excel shortcut junkie and have had no issues looking forward to continue using the keyboard ,5
these do not fit on the head well my head falls under the size fits most category in terms of hats glasses and headsets this does not additionally they do not cancel any noise at all finally the one received had to have the mic put right to my mouth to pick up any sounds no matter how much played around with the settings understand that this is cheap pair but that doesnt mean that the product shouldnt work sound quality is alright ,1
these ended up being bit of disappointment we got them for our son for christmas and we didn realize that in order for the lights to work the cord also needs to be plugged into usb port he was using them mostly with tablet so this was bummer now only three months later the cord has completely severed and they don work at all these have had extremely light wear and tear never leaving the house and only used for couple hours day ,5
this mouse has met all of my requirements when my old wireless mouse began to die opted for this rechargeable one because was sick of batteries this has very long battery life as use it for up to hours in row use it for gaming league of legends and it works perfectly no lag and it crazy cute to boot with all of it colours and such haven had it very long about month and half but very happy with it so far ,5
this mouse is great and if it didn do this one annoying thing would give it stars it emits really high pitched squeal when you don use mousepad it coincides with the led light color change if you pick it up and set it down it makes really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in quiet environment which do it similar to smoke alarm if it were far away get one that doesn have the lights that should help ,1

this mouse worked well for while months but now it is very unreliable switched usb ports got an extender thinking the connector was blocked by my metal desk that helped some but it lags and the click only works about half the time have classroom full of first graders who are waiting on my silly mouse to get it together so can show them the next slide or open the video for them it has been super frustrating will be purchasing another brand ,1

this mouse works well for my needs and fits in my medium sized hands well this is the first mouse ve ever owned with built in rechargeable battery and now don ever want to own one without it the small form factor is also nice for packing up and taking on the go another nicely designed element is that the nano receiver tucks into the bottom of the mouse and doesn require prying off cover or any extra effort to remove or insert ,5

after having the jbl flip for several years and loving it decided to upgrade and purchase the jbl charge bought it new and once it came in tested it out however the sound quality was extremely distorted and sounded like the speaker was already blown because the bass was so scratchy even at volume am not sure if this is an issue with the jbl charge or the individual speaker received either way will be returning this product and am very disappointed ,5
delivery was fantastic on time to collection point near my place arrived in days singapore also appreciate delivery updates via telegram ninjabot prompt the keyboard is brightly lit keys are responsive works like dream setup usb was without hitch as well packaging was good gee there were even nice stickers given and nice welcome note from the company looks like they take pride in their work awesome def good buy don see why any should spend more money on big brand names ,5
i just recently got into using mouse and keyboard for fps games such as cod and this is my first keyboard overall good keyboard keys are firm but press easy some buttons are shaped different than usual but that makes it easier to use them ie the enter button sweet color display goes into sleep mode after about minutes of not use to conserve battery but shoots right on as soon as you hit button over good keyboard works with xbox one,5
i really want to like this mouse even more than do the colors are cute but it has flicker that just goes consistently wish could continue to use this but think am going to have to get something else the flicker drives me nuts charged it fully and there is no reason it should not work when just got it today it would also be nice if the charge cord was long enough that you could use it while it was charging ,5

i work from home and have to run more than one screen and this mouse was amazing when bought it now it has decided that it doesn want to charge and is currently useless after only week was about to buy another one for my mom but have canceled it now since this one has stopped working it sucks because it such fun mouse it also never leaves my home office so know it not from packing or moving it around lot,5
new outcome had issues with my st keyboard reached out to the seller and they helped me troubleshoot my device until we figured it needed to be replaced they gladly sent me new keyboard which is now working as expected will definitely recommend this brand old review this keyboard is rechargable and does not have an option fir batteries it worked for month and half it doesnt hold charge mine diesn work at all wasted and now need to buy another keyboard ,5
ok like to recommend that you really think about buying mouse that requires charging via usb cable because when this puppy goes dead you can work until you charge it work from home so use my mouse from am until about pm nonstop have to charge every day otherwise dead in about two days tops so do like the mouse but unlike just popping in some new batteries and you re good to go you have to remember to charge it lol ,1
purchased back in november thought this keyboard would have lasted lot longer when first purchased the keyboard it worked fine on my pc after month it stopped working and gave message saying the bluetooth software is outdated went to the klim website to update the bluetooth by downloading file that didn work connected the keyboard to another pc still would not work literally the keyboard stopped working after month due to the bluetooth being outdated or not compatible what waste of money ,1
so got this in the mail and immediately started using it it worked great in the beginning super quiet and the color change is cool but after week or two was using it and it just stopped working it would turn on but wouldn work on my laptop and it was the only computer have used it on can barely get it to move on the screen and then it just shuts off but it really was great when first got it ,1

so needed good quality wireless keyboard but was little unsure any would meet my standards as techie and have huge tv and distance to my couch where was going to play pc games from just wow this thing has the responsiveness of wired gaming keyboard feels great to handle and use it at nearly feet away to boot it actually better than some of my professional keyboards use at nearly the cost totally worth the buy and the battery lasts ridiculously long ,5
the cool features for gaming notwithstanding multi colored back light keys that can breathe or rotate this is an excellent all around multi function keyboard for general pc workload including function buttons that allow dimming brightness volume control etc keys are responsive and charge lasts about hours of gaming depending on usage and how bright the settings of the back lighting for the keys are set plus the customer service at klim is top notch highly recommended you will not be disappointed ,5
the design is nice but these headsets aren worth it it use to light up when plugged in and play sounds loudly when first got it but not anymore the sound has to much bass and staticky from the beginning the microphone would not work despite following the instructions to turn it on so just used it for work to hear notifications when stepped away my computer won recognize the headset anymore even when the lights are turned on just prop now ,1
the klim is extremely quiet which is the number one thing that is important to me battery life is great plus it is rechargeable my only complaint is the connection would rate it about due to it sometimes randomly losing connection after two months my key is starting to rub off back light to the keyboard is perfect in my opinion price for the keyboard is really good think this keyboard will last about year for me overall great keyboard love it ,5
these charge speakers are great bought more to go with couple already had they easily sync up with each other which makes it easy to fill larger spaces with great sound if you put them in corners they sound even fuller wish that the charge still had to ability to take phone calls but guess that isn that big of deal the batteries have listed all day and more it is also handy that can charge my phone from them as well ,5
when listening while doing chores it needs to carry through every room and this speaker does the trick through dog barks and other household noises can still hear the song or speaker the only drawback is that the bluetooth does not connect to other generations of jbl speakers threes connect only with other threes fours connect only with fours it would not have changed my particular purchase and circumstance but will affect my future purchases because will match the system for linking ,5
 finally sleep mode works on this upgraded led mouse sleep mode is must for mouse because not every time you ll remember to turn it off plus why bother turning it off while your going for short break or so it does it for you to save battery note sleep mode does work on color mode the previous mouse wouldn sleep on color mode but this upgraded mouse surly does and wish it had bluetooth it would be the perfect mouse ,5

i bought five of them this year and three already broke after few months of light use two had the plastic wheel axle broken the another one just stopped charging and not recognized by windows anymore in addition the usb dongle cover separated and got stuck in the laptop usb port this mouse is flimsy and does not last not very ergonomical as well cool lights is the only positive thing to say about this mouse but it eats battery avoid ,1

i bought the white one and at first it was only lighting up red and thought the picture was misleading then realized the on off switch on the bottom actually serves two functions one click on will turn the mouse on and glowing red two clicks on and the rainbow colors appear will say the white mouse is almost translucent the rainbow colors illuminate the whole mouse not just the sides it plug and play very easy to use and comfortable ,5

i bought this for working at home general use was sick of my old mouse running out of batteries when didn have any works great for general use and battery lasts while but haven done any button mashing games with it my only complaint is the usb remote plugin fits tight into the underside for storage you have to dig with your nail to remove it small infrequent task but for me if it was corrected its an ideal computer mouse ,5

i gave it four star rating only because we realized that to use it for the xbox one you can have the lights on at the same time for talking because the plugs for the lights has to be plugged into the xbox it self but to talk the plug has to be plugged into the controller and the cords split off of each other so it not long enough other than that it works great and my son loves it,5
i got tired of using my laptop keyboard and decided rj invest love the led colors with the mouse although rarely change the settings love that don have to switch batteries and all have to do plug it in could tell after about week including me leaving my mouse on few times that it was time for charge my mouse began to lag and went ahead and plugged it up also the color of the mouse matches with the picture well,1

i like stuff loud bit of an audiophile but don like spending lot unless it worth it prefer cheap and effective and that is this used to use the official playstation wireless headphones that cost over and those were great but then they stopped charging and got these freed up the usb port that was being used by the wireless headphones because these headphones plug into the wireless controller so for lot less money it still wireless and they sound great ,5
i ordered this product but the cursor kept jumping around the screen even when it was fully charged figured just got bad apple so made an exchange for new one the new mouse came scratched not big deal and the scroll wheel wasn as smooth annoying but its fine but this one cursor is jumping around the screen too would have otherwise liked the mouse it charges up quickly and appreciate the sleep mode so that that battery life lasts longer ,5

i really liked the mouse at first it matched perfectly and was very convenient first thing noticed was how plasticy it was that didn bother me tho one day as was using the mouse to scroll the little scroll wheel fell into the mouse tried to fix it and couldn wasn pressing hard on it and it always stayed on my desk its cute mouse love the look of it but it is very cheaply made and will most likely break ,5

i really love how easy it is to setup this mouse nothing to download just plug and play have been looking for slim mouse that works on my mac and windows machine that doesn need batteries or mousepad and this definitely fits the bill the lights are cute fun addition but are subtle enough to not be distraction while using and don seem to drain the battery too much overall think it great for anyone looking for something easy to use ,1

i recently bought new chromebook and wanted wireless mouse to match came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it try cant say how good it works yet because never recieved the usb adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well otherwise its slim which is what wanted and like the lights on it,5

i ve actually purchased two of these and both broke in the same way the scroller do not recommend if you need them for any kind of gaming that requires the scroller need to use it for camera angles in game and without it gameplay is awful won be buying third one but if that not gonna be problem for you then these will probably be great they hold charge well and the light show they put on is really cool ,1

i was looking for another headset because the one was using wasn working how it should and when saw this one with all the good reviews decided to try it and this headset rocks for the price love the sound dial and the mute switch use it for ps but the lights would be cool if were on pc pretty light weight and it overall seems like it decent quality headset would definitely buy again if something happens to this one ,1
i work from home and in the office have to transport my laptop and mouse have forgotten my mouse more time that can remember at the office bought of these so can keep at home and at the office they only hold charge for less than week it might have to do with it having lights on it but my other mouse holds charge of heavy usage for month will not buy again as need something to hold charge much longer ,1
it came really fast got it in one day it is really sleek and works really smooth chose my favorite color of course but love all the colors the light goes through also really like that it has button to keep the mouse on but turn off the light and of course it is nice that you can charge it rather than use batteries the other mouse have have to use batteries so that was major selling point for this one ,5

it feels cheap compared to my corsair it is just average sorry but am spoiled the only thing it has going for it is that it is wireless which is why will keep and use it the keyboard seems to be smaller am touch typist and my fingers feel cramped think it impedes my typing speed pretty good at above wpm don use it for gaming write voraciously and need keyboard that has quick response this one is ummmmm just okay ,5
it wasn until my husband gave me his mouse to play my sims with that realized how much loved using one even on laptop he said could have his red and black one but lo and behold when opened up amazon and put in wireless mouse found my own type of dream mouse got the mint green colored one and honestly obsessed with the glowing of the different colors great mouse great price wish needed more than one to be honest ,1

its really light weight and you don hear the mouse clicks however the usb blutooth is located at the bottom of the mouse didn have tough enough finger nails to pull the usb out logitech has their blutooth in the mouse where the battery is located but this didn have visible battery so used the tip of knife to pop the usb out almost nicked my hand from the blade getting the usb out you may do better job than me ,5

like the light weight and wireless battery life is good too too bad today my and buttons stopped working have tried in my laptop and my pc and both have the same results guess since am out of my return window will try to contact the company and see if they will service it and if not will just open it up myself and see what has gone wrong very disappointing that this keyboard lasted few months do not buy this,5
love this mouse it very smooth and the battery life last pretty long the led lights are bright but not too distracting if like to game in the dark like do ended up losing the small piece that goes plugs into my computer tho wish could just order that piece also if the charger was bit longer that would be better hate trying to use the mouse while plugged in charging it has no range other than that it good buy,5

really nice headset the only note ve got is if you are using this for ps the usb placement to power up the lights on the headset is right next to the audio jack like connected away not very practical and you have to put usb extension on it if you want to power up the lights could care less about the lights so ve got high marks for this great noise cancellation sound is crisp and headset is very comfortable ,5
the headset is pretty good price very easy to start using and has sleek cool design to match it cancels out noise pretty good as well for example it blocks out the noise caused by fan have in my room my only actual complaint is that it is kind of small like it covers my ears completely but only barely does it do that if you are around or younger it should be fine but you may want bigger size otherwise ,5
the product description is correct and found nothing wrong with the headset it has both pin jack and usb connector on the end it did not work quickly on my pc did not do any problem solving because did not like the fit the pads are oval and not as soft as wanted wear glasses and so they pushed my ear around the glasses and were uncomfortable for me there was nothing wrong with them they just were not for me ,5
the product lasts about minutes and dies have charged it so many times and it still needs to be plugged in to work even when plugged in it still only lasts another minutes seller is in violation of amazon terms of agreement continually contacting customer private email asking to remove review review is factual and customer will continue to report abuse to amazon through email community help com do not purchase product due to poor quality and unregulated customer service practices ,5

the sound isn as good as had hoped but the awful range of the bluetooth was the absolute deal breaker fully charged it can keep solid bluetooth connection to my computer that literally feet across the living room it breaks up so bad that it was unbearable to listen to wondering if the problem was actually my computer switched to little jbl clip that have and it worked flawlessly the charge was total failure and is being returned to best buy ,5
this is the second set of this brand of headphones ve used and just as satisfied as was the first time it has everything shown in the picture and splitter from the headphone jack to microphione and headphone jack the usb port gives it the lights the audio quality is pretty good if not bit bass but with some adjusting it pretty good for music it has good somewhat heavy feel to it and the foam is firm but not uncomfortable ,5
this keyboard is great the room work in can get pretty dark and the backlit keys are so fun and functional the usb cord broke and asked customer service what should look for to replace it and they sent me free one free of charge had another keyboard that used while waited for the cord and this one is so much better the keys feel good and can type fast without missing letters great value great keyboard and great customer service ,1
update had it charging for less than minute and the whole house smelled like burning plastic in that time the cord got super hot and the part where it plugged into the mouse was super hot as well probably would have caught fire if left unattended update using different cords was just fine do not use the cord that comes with it update battery won hold charge was really wanting this mouse to work but looks like returning it after all ,5

 works well until it goes into sleep mode when you wake it up the cursor is incredibly laggy and skips around the only way to get that to stop is to turn it off and then back on which seems minuscule but it gets really annoy the longer you use it maybe just got defective one it got some really high marks but buyer beware video shows it being woken up then turn it off on and it works fine ,1

after exactly two months the roller wheel in the middle broke tried prying it apart and it is not fixable and is pain to always have to use the scrollbar with the mouse the lights are kind of distracting not necessary however it does stay charged for week or more at time cheap and bought this for data work it works other than the middle wheel now and is okay for the price or if you don have high expectations ,5

after using it for couple hours on its initial charge plugged it in using the given charging cable but it would never charge plugged it in to my computer the wall and with different usb charger and nothing worked cannot recommend anyone to purchase this product when it does not charge properly if it worked would have given it star review because it looks nice has rgb and had very little latency despite being wireless do not buy this product ,5
got it for family member they have been very happy with the keyboard battery life could last longer but is still good for night of gaming keyboard works while charging if you need to play for the full day and the on off switch really helps save power when you take break one problem to not is that keyboard remains on while changing even if you switch it off this is minor problem but could be larger issues for others ,1
have been using it nonstop since got it the look of the keyboard is super sleek and nice love the colors and the auto shut off of the lights when not being used has type charger so it works great with your phone charger if you have an android phone keys do not make noise which is nice connected quickly to my laptop no problems at all wish the company would make wireless mouse to go with this keyboard though ,5
hello received the new mouse today thank you and your service is very good again thank you but the only concern that have is that the box is open and my power cord is dirty and not wrapped up the way it should have been but that is okay am going to plug this one in and it work then we are good to go again thank you so such for fast re supply give you stars mr ronald wooten,5
i don normally like using mouse when am on my laptop but they built in keys on my laptop were starting to go so decided to purchase mouse when looking for mouse wanted something sleek and able to take with me to school and back it fits my hand perfectly and enjoy how sleek it looks the only thing that would change is being able to decide the color and color patterns other than that it was worth the purchase ,5

i had different models was time for new one since going out town ship was fast but the thing would not stay connected to any phone for music or call sent back and had to go purchase from store and pay little more but no issues and sounds great sent back got refund for broken one understand that not seller fault they can test new equipment and not all will function out box correctly so for the hassle gave stars,5
i have trouble getting it to keep up good audio sometimes it ok but it been going downhill steadily for year mic has only one axis of rotation so can get it closer to my mouth that part of the issue but only part it also not very comfy as the spring force is too strong and the earmuffs too firm overall they are cheap and they feel like it and sound like it would get something better were you ,1
i needed mouse for my laptop for around the same price as big name mouse you can get mouse that works just as well and looks cool with it led lights and it rechargeable the lights can be switched off if they are too distracting but admit like them it isn quite as ergonomic as some mice but it fits nicely into my laptop bag usb receiver is small enough to leave in my laptop without it getting yanked out ,1
i not going to lie this is probably the most awesome portable speaker have ever had in my life the battery lasts like hours and at links with other speakers which is awesome my only problem is don li had it months and it already stopped taking charge this is my nd jbl speaker to do that so don know if it just product problem or what but if it wasn for that would have given this out of stars ,1
i own at top of the line bose bluetooth speaker friend needed recommendation but the bose was twice the price of the jbl imagined the jbl would sound good it jbl after all delivered the jbl charge to my friend last night and we were blown away fabulous sound beautiful design excellent user interface wonderful that it recharged from standard usb power supply completely happy that it doesn come with one who doesn have extras this jbl product is superb ,5
i purchased these to use with my ps and the sound is fine and all but it has too many wires attached to it you have wire with the aux jack that connects to your controller and then you have usb wire that you need to plug into the console if you want the headphones to light up the lights are purely cosmetic but it annoying to have an extra wire attached to the controller if it not being used ,5
i purchased this to replace broken battery operated cordless mouse think dropped it one too many times thought would give this rechargeable mouse try hope that won have to recharge it too often only had to do the initial charge so far and do lot of clicking also chose this one for its flatter design my other one was higher and after using it long time my hand got stiff maybe this one won do that so far it hasn ,5

i really liked this mouse the design is sleek can use the little attachment for my mac to make it compatible and it maneuvered well however after only few weeks of use the top plastic portion that splits down the middle to accommodate left and right clicking just literally spit apart and now my mouse is not functional very disappointed in the quality and durability of this item however gave it stars for the awesome performance prior to it breaking ,1

i use this guy all day every literally work in remodel and have it playing from and then use it at the weekend to for grilling out on the boat or riding my bike sound is great good bass for little guy and gets loud enough for what you need from speaker this size easy to charge and last long time only wish it would tell you when the battery was low with noise and not just die on me ,1
imho think these are the best headphones for the price they are extremely durable and can withstand many drops without problem my grandpa got them for me and love them they even come with usb cable for led lights and an adapter to be able to use the microphone and headphones at the same time the headphone mic quality is actually really good for any type of work or gaming so in my opinion this product has five star rating ,1
my previous mouse wheel stopped working love the shape slim design of this mouse the lights are pretty cool it is so nice if forget to turn off it goes to sleep very reactive it is perfect replacement update only lasted months now the pointer is not controllable have tried everything can think of thought it was my laptop started using computer pad and the issue is not there it is the mouse very disappointed so am changing my review ,1
perfect size and sound for small to medium size areas drive truck and use it to listen to podcasts and music on my nightly run from atlanta to nashville and back also use it out in my wood shop like having the same sound quality in the places spend the most of my time it super easy to pair up very durable just toss it in my backpack without any type of protection and it does just fine highly recommend ,5
product didn work straight out of the box unfortunately we didn get to use the product within the return window so out the cost of the product never could get it to connect even though we followed the troubleshooting guide downloaded from the manufacturer light came on when you typed but nothing every showed on the screen not impressed though with the hour charge use stated on the box for that you might as well get wireless unit with batteries ,1
the pictures are how the product arrived it was packaged in cheap plastic bag and the box was mutated this was supposed to be gift for my son and didn have time to replace it the delivery was late which would have been just fine if it didn arrive like this didn work not sure if it didn work because of the delivery or because of the product do not buy this you will not get what you were expecting ,1
this is still stars because description is correct and perfect for price nothing else will beat it best for laptop pc gaming but bought it for ps console so the lighting feature won work because the usb cable is not long enough to reach the console while also having the auxiliary plugged into your ps remote what you can do is have phone charging battery pack with you to have it power up the led lights lol that what did,5
this is the best wireless mouse ve ever used the flat profile keeps my arthritic hand from getting stiff and sore after long use the colors are subtle enough to be fun but not intrusive if you plan to use it with desktop computer be aware that the charging cord is very short so using the mouse while charging may be problem use it with laptop where this is not an obstacle the mouse appears very well made and sturdy ,1

this keyboard looked great in the amazon pix and had great reviews unfortunately never got around to actually trying it out until days after the return window closed hate this thing and will never use it for several reasons the actual keys don light up just the areas underneath them and it very dim it not bright at all and can distinguish any changes when use the brightness keys the static breathing doesn change at all when press the keys ,1
this mouse was purchased for use with my laptop ve purchased two of the same brand previously but wanted something different so took chance on this unknown the mouse is light and ergonomic have fairly small hand and it fits well connection was simple the sleep mode will definitely increase battery life add to this the pretty lights and lovely rose color pleasantly surprised would recommend this mouse to anyone who wants an inexpensive and uncomplicated addition to their setup ,1

wish hadn missed the return window on this one this mouse does not have range of meters as stated it has difficulty tracking at just meter or even couple of feet away this was supposed to replace mouse from another seller that also had trouble with it turned out to be the same exact mouse it disheartening to find out that multiple companies are selling the same useless products would recommend spending little more money on mouse from reputable brand ,5

 when opened my mouse noticed there were scratches on the top of the mouse towards the area where your palm would rest when in use also noticed that the adapter that arrived with the mouse did not fit the usb that would make the mouse compatible with my macbook so had to use different adapter considering paid for new mouse was expecting to get better quality gave the mouse second chance and this time received one that didn work ,1

decent speaker nothing revelatory but the form factor is great it gets the noise out there effectively pros battery life feels like it infinite bluetooth connectivity is the best ve ever experienced handsome unit cons thuddy sound but some of that is bluetooth some of that is streaming some of that is the fact that it not very big overall effectively fills the sonic gap between my home speakers and my laptop which is what it was meant for ,5
great speaker provides good sound and lasts long time the reason for the star deduction is because the battery didn last as long as advertised took it on float trip and it died about hours in granted had it turned up max the entire time and it was hot day but think it should have lasted longer also the sound on the float wasn as loud as would have liked it was incredibly sturdy and portable no complaints there ,1
i absolutely love this mouse super handy dandy because not only does it work with my mac it also works with my work laptop which is dell the only thing don like about it is that if you don use it for while it shuts off mean it great because it saves energy so you don have to charge it often but meh ve yet to charge it again used it for days for at least hours each day ,5

i am writing the review on behalf of the comments made by my grandson he stated they are stellar feel so comfortable on the microphone works excellent he said he could hear things perfectly and keep the outside noise out the look is awesome he is happy to have upgraded to this headset was very happy with the price and quality would buy them again most definitely and highly recommend for their performance price and look of this headset ,5
i bought pairs of these as gifts and both pairs were major pain in the to connect to pc for gaming sound quality is very decent for price but would not reorder due to connectivity issue do not even know how finally got it to work my pc settings are whack now but they have headset to use mic is not the greatest must speak loudly to hear and does not shut off even when button is switched off ,5
i got this mouse for work it works great however it needs to be charged and unfortunately it can be used with battery it only usb charger so the only down side of this if work with it for days will need to charge it or it will die on and have to keep charging it in ur laptop to keep using it it unfortunately not for me and don like how it doesn have battery or dies fast ,1

i really wasnt expecting this to sound and be as good as it is can literally hear the speaker from outside my house while the bass is the main star of the show it leaves me little disappointed that the treble and other minor but important rythms get drowned out lot of the time it could also be the music play so cant fault it too much overall really glad got what paid for and bit more as well,5
i thought was getting better mouse by splurging on the more expensive option but guess that doesn seem to matter would think get decent working product for bucks but guess that also doesn seem to be thing save yourself the trouble of thinking this is quality product and actually buy mouse that works have had all similar issues of not working after about month of use broke college student and really wish could have saved myself time and money ,1
i used this mouse once after this use it died so was going to charge it up figuring didn give it enough time to charge tried different times and it wouldn charge at all so decided to just go back to my old mouse tried to remove the usb and the metal part broke off and stayed inside my laptop so had to remove it and there was no fixing it so disappointed in the quality of this mouse ,5

i was initially in love with this mouse however soon after while scrolling the mouse stopped scrolling you don realize how something so small you really see crucial everything works for the scroll to just stop literally want to throw the whole mouse out and probably will decided to hold on to it cause it just so cute and matches my laptop however soon after the sensor and clicker stopped working as well now forced to get new mouse ,5

if you re touch typist expect to be slowed down and make lot of mistakes because the enter key is much further to the right than any other keyboard ve ever used because of this this keyboard is very uncomfortable to use the keys resist bit but bounce back slowly it very easy for fast typist to get letters out of order because they keyboard just isn responsive enough don see how anyone would accept this as gaming keyboard ,5
if your looking for wireless gaming keyboard that won set you back few hundred bucks this is the keyboard for you honestly was expecting piece of junk for the price but also didn want to spend bunch on an expensive gaming keyboard as im not an avid player this keyboard is quiet easy to set up and boy its cheap even if you dont like it you can always give it to someone and they probably would appreciate it ,5
it fine keyboard for the amount paid but it doesn work as well as some other wireless keyboards the charge didn seem to hold too long for mine feel like have to charge it often also needed it to be on my craft table which is not too far from my computer but the distance can use it wirelessly is poor needed it to allow me to work farther from my computer but couldn go as far as wanted ,5
it was working well until it just stopped working after months it won charge and turn on anymore pretty much useless now not well made and it waste of money if you re looking for reliable and and an item that will last long do not get this one coz you will be disappointed tried my luck and didn listen to the reviews read now am so disappointed could have spend more to most reliable and long lasting one ,1

overall the headphones felt like plastic toy you buy from the dollar store there is no noise cancellation because they don close around your ears completely not sure if this is flaw in design or got pair that was made incorrectly but either way save your money for this price you can get something better and not have to go through the hassle of returning it or the disappointment of thinking you re getting something good for the price ,1
overall underwhelming headset given it cheap price sure it could meet your needs don like that the ear muffs don turn so its kind of uncomfortable to wear can imagine wearing these for long periods of time the chord connector is obnoxiously long unless this is something you re looking for mic settings mute is all basic controls which is expected with lower price point mic overall not practical for long term use in my opinion will be returning ,5
starting using on april and when came back to my desk yesterday it had completely stopped working can not charge it tried on multiple computers and the computers won acknowledge it if it not plugged in directly which defeats the purpose of the wireless chargeable mouse don buy if you are looking for long term option and can find way to contact the company the only option amazon gives me is to leave review can not contact the seller ,1

the color wasn like the photo it bit darker than what was expecting see photo for reference did love that the mouse came with usb to usb adapter the part that connects to the computer for wireless capabilities was stuck so had to use excessive force to remove it only other thing could change is the led colors it goes through series of colors but it would be fun to be able to choose what color it could be ,1

the mouse came as described with the option chose however after letting it charge for the recommended time before use it would not connect to my computer turned it off and then back on and it worked for about minutes within that minutes only showed one color the whole time it never worked again afterwards just went and bought mouse from walmart and it works like perfect even more sturdier than this one don waste your money on this ,5

the wireless mouse worked well in the begining it was small but it fit in my hand well and the lights were nice though not necessary feature received it in september it wasnt something used every day about once or twice week in february the scroll wheel just broke it spins loosely and no longer scrolls on the screen do not use it often and am definitely not rough on it am dissapointed in the quality of this product ,1

there reason these headphones are super cheap because they are it comes with usb and mm plugs so you ve got an overabundance of wires to deal with right off the bat the mic doesn go any lower than the image shows so find myself yelling into the mic to be heard by my team and they tell me the sound quality of the mic isn that good when replace these ll spend more money on higher quality set ,1
these headsets bought pairs didn even work right the first time either were used clicking the sound button does nothing to shut the sound off nor does switching the mic part up there are just time while playing cod where everyone does not need to hear my background noise one of the pairs got stuck all the way extended and can get it to go back in all in all say invest bit more money and get nicer pair ,1
this is realy bad mouse iv used it for about weeks now and the sensor only picks up half of my movements the rgb is basally non existent and the feel of this mouse is realy crapy it seems can just break it with hand the batterie life is also terrible if it could not get worse then this the company actually buys the reviews by sending you money via paypal so don let the reviews make your decision,1

this product is amazing the sound is really clear the design make you look like pro gamer this headphone is flexible and it has the cushion for your head the previous ones own are kinda rigid so it normally broke near areas bending occurs one thing not fan of is where the headphone volume controller is placed also the headphone volume controller can sometimes makes the sound off like the left side is little louder then the right side ,1
this was gift for one of my grandsons and he uses it with his switch his brother also has one that he has had for about year so asked them about their experiences grandson says he likes the mic and the noise cancellation helps with any surround sound overall they are perfect for any device with circle headphone slot grandson says he loves them they are comfortable and can be adjusted he likes the mic they say five stars ,1
update downgrading from stars to jbl has terrible customer service at best if you have questions no one will help this comes with usb cord only nothing to charge to wall outlet if you want to hear text message sound notification through your speaker forget it the original jbl charge does allow message sound notifications you have to have your phone next to you constantly which totally defeats the purpose it step back will be returning this very disappointed ,1
another solid product from jbl ve seen lot of reviews complain about the sound quality let be real for an item that can be fully submerged and still have the same great sound it did before it got wet its good bang for your buck it was more then loud enough for my back yard are you going feel like your at concert no are you going to be able to hear the song played while swimming yes ,5
bought these for my son for his bday ordered them ahead of time and put back by the time he received these as gift they worked for whole weeks and the sound went out in them highly disappointed that couldn swap out since they were out of that time frame seller reached out about giving refund if edited or removed comment back in february and haven received any update and it almost may definitely not worth the money,5
doesn stay connected hard to tell when charged has to be charged constantly which negates the convenience of cordless it looks cute and feels good but obviously cheap plastic am returning it to buy different mouse with better performance that uses battery so does not need to be hooked up to usb port and charged constantly fyi on seller emailed me and wanted me to remove the review they say they are switching manufacturers let the buyer beware ,5
don waste your time with this cheap ass headset was expecting something to at least work when unboxed it and was disappointed even wasted my time reading the manual and watching youtube video to make sure it was on year old college kid who just needed mic to play with my friends but just gonna say whatever and buy quality one from best buy save your money and time and don buy this for your kids or anyone ,5
i absolutely love this mouse first off have to say my cat has knocked this done off the table multiple times and it still works that is huge with me next it very nice mouse love the colors it lights up with its so nice to not have to worry about battery too just plug in and charge and ready to go swear charge it like once month too and it still works great highly recommend this mouse ,1

i bought this to replace my year old ue boom there was nothing wrong with my boom just wanted an upgrade so thought it was bigger than my ue boom which was no big deal but after charged the jbl and connected it was very disappointed the sound was very muffled hooked up my boom to friend phone and played the same sound on both what huge difference in my opinion the ue boom blows this jbl away ,5
i didnt like the dim features im using razer keyboard now and its alot brighter than this aloso hated the feature where it would turn off after few seconds interferred big time with my gaming and cant see where this can be gaming keyboard as such games as skyrim and fallout require you to make last minute decisions as for regular keyboard for regular things its good but gaming naw its waste of money sorry guys its flop ,5
i have only purchase it for about weeks and this headset sucks plug it into my ps controller and for some reason it keeps messing with the controller it keeps automatically scrolling up and down like you are holding down the stick the sound and mic are fine so far but not woth it when you have trouble selecting an option in game have to unplug the headset to be able to select then plug it back in ,5
i liked that the sound quality was great for the price it comfortable although haven worn for more than an hour but sure it will still be comfortable only drawback is the version got had the usb and six cable too short to separate can only plug in one or the other usb is used to light up and six is for the sound so either get lights or sound but not together unless hookup to power bank ,5
i loved this mouse for the literal two weeks days that had it and it was working for no apparent reason the scroll wheel just suddenly stopped working approximately five seconds after had last used it had not subjected it to any pressure or abuse of any sort was looking at document scrolled down continued reading tried to scroll down and nope in the lower ratings this seems to be common problem bummed really did love the mouse ,5

i read so many reviews and went back and forth on whether to get this speaker now that ve heard it sound quality so glad decided to go with this charge speaker the sound is amazing and the battery last forever take it with me on the golf course and people wonder how this speaker can generate such great sound it little bigger than others but so worth the extra punch you get from the sound it generates,5
i spend hrs on the computer day for work and gaming this is the best keyboard on the market not only that my windows key stopped working tried troubleshooting but thought it was broke opened up support case with klim support and within the hour they replied with thorough set of troubleshooting ideas turns on there is windows key lock that my year old little guy turned on amazing support ll only be buying klim products moving forward ,5
i use this mouse for work it didn require any weird setup like downloading software it super comfy and has sleep mode that activates after about minutes click of the button wakes it up and it ready to go don regularly use the light up mode but it is cool feature that is fun to show off have carpal tunnel and it so much better on my wrist than standard wired computer mouse most definitely worth the purchase ,5

i wanted wireless mouse and this one fit my needs it is rechargeable and can be turned off which helps save battery power it can also be used while the charging cable is plugged in if necessary the colors are great touch and use them depending on the mood in at the time also like being able to choose the resolution on the fly with the button on the top have already recommended it to couple of friends ,5

my boys love to game on their computer xbox and nintendo switch this headset is great for all gaming experience great sound and microphone the only reason did not give it stars is the cord can get tangled easily and when that happens it doesn give the star experience have bought several of these though and will continue to get the same as they get worn out the price for the quality of the product is worth it ,5
not worth it if you re looking for something to work longer than couple of months my son was able to get couple of months use out of it before the mic stopped working then he would have to hold the cord certain way for him to hear out of one side it wasn worth doing all that so we tossed it since was passed the return deadline would be very weary of those so called stars reviews ,5
product came in good box along with humorous company statement however everything afterwards was dismay the wireless keyboards has lot of lag the simplest way to describe it is pretty decent gamer and getting owned by noobs because of this system don even get me started on just using it for daily mundane tasks check and write emails the system would lag so much that would rather write whole essay in my cellphone and send it that way ,5
stopped working after the second week charged it overnight every night before left the office and it was working fine then it started skipping so tried to put it on the charger for the day and used another mouse thinking maybe it just didn charge the night before then when took it off it wouldn work at all but it does feel great in your hands and the lighting is pretty cool just wish it would have lasted ,5

the color and shape are very nice but the mouse and the packaging arrived very dirty the scroll wheel on the mouse is made from cheap rubbery silicone material and is completely crooked it also did not have good feel when testing it out not smooth and feels like it take lot of extra pressure to operate than others not sure if this is due to it being crooked or not but either way this will be returned ,1

the keyboard is very light and doesn feel too cheap but it never detected on my dell computer not sure if it my software windows or the keyboard but it would light up and then go dark when tried typing on it the manual didn explain anything because the keyboard is supposed to automatically be detected and work my other vic mouse and redragon keyboard work just fine returning for refund will stick with my wired for now ,5
they sound pretty good and they feel reasonably comfortable but they feel cheap and the audio output is terrible the guys play with don really understand what saying most of the time so spent bit more money and got myself nice pair they re decent backup pair edit bengoo just reached out to me to refund the product if changed my review respect them trying to make it right but on the other hand don like review bribery,5
this is the best gaming headset we have purchased to date durable good noise cancellation great sound we ve had these for little over year and compared to others we ve gotten on amazon with great reviews these are the only ones that live up to their star ratings we now own the orange and the purple pairs and have recommended this particular set to friends who have purchased as well good buy can say enough good things ,5
very reactive but not quite membrane and not as quiet as they claim took minute to get used to how loud the space bar especially was but love the colors and how quick it wakes sleeps holds long charge and recharges quickly have carpal tunnels and this is easier on my hands than even my macbook air ergonomic and reactive granted its not wake the family loud or anything but far from silent my favorite keyboard ever nevertheless ,5
was so excited for this mouse loved the style and lights when ordered it once received it used it for approx half day and then it died and never turned back on charged it through the pc for quite while when realized it hadnt charged tried wall outlet never turned back on went through some of the reviews after and realized it was running theme and that many other customers had the same experience dont waste your time ,5

we tried the charge too small for our needs extreme was too much base the charge is just right has lots of sound for an outdoor venue we are wanting to have music at yet can be turned down to still hear the clarity of the instruments the battery stays charged for days of playing definately hours or more we bought two to sync together for our outdoor gathering area we have been quite happy with this model ,1
while the overall sound is decent for the price bought two speakers specifically for the party feature which is supposed to allow two or more of the same speakers to connect and play together ve had nothing but problems with that feature ve tried resetting per company instructions even sent them back and got two new speakers but the same problems exist if you want one speaker go right ahead but would advise against getting more than one ,5
worked great the first week stopped holding charge and working after the second week sent back after month of having because it wasn worth the effort of charging to full only for it to work for hours if at all can even have it plugged in and charging while using so that wasn even possible work around bought different brand and have been using for few months without any issues don waste your time with this wireless keyboard ,5
a little difficult trying to tie to of them together finally found the trick turn both on let them automatically connect to phone one connected hit the stereo mode buttons at same time for me it worked every time have to buy two atleast because in stereo mode they sound great bass is decent not as much as like but they have great sound quality so if your sound quality and not bass person these are good ,5
bought this at the end of september it about months now and for the past several weeks the keyboard hasn been working ve tried everything it lights up when click keys but it doesn type and then the rgb colors just go away it was constantly plugged in since the battery life was terrible but now it looks like wasted money and will need to go back to my old keyboard find different keyboard don buy this ,1
considering it keyboard and the title indicates long lasting rechargeable battery you expect the charge to last little longer the fancy glow lights obviously drain it faster than you expect it gives you no warning when the charge is low just quits and you have to plug it in otherwise it is keyboard the lights are cool bought this for the cordless factor after it charged but it the star feeling not bad not great it fine ,1
great for the first month got now one of them sounds like crap buzzing on the bass even at moderate volume don blast it either so figure it must be build quality update second one has gotten flaky after running the power to zero once it is usually plugged in all the time as speaker for my amazon echo and got unplugged when furniture got moved disappointed that flagship company like jbl would have such poor quality ,1
i am big on reviews peoples honest opinions when it counts as for style it nice mouse but for the main purpose of the mouse it is not good even if it completely charged it will only work for about minutes before it starts to freeze then eventually go dead it very frustrating annoying especially if you work from home would of posted pic but am in the process of returning it don feel like getting it ,5

i bought this because it is gaming headphone and the reviews looked to be good quality however plugged it into my pc and at first only the audio output was working and recognized on my computer when unplugged it to see if that would fix the microphone not being recognized the sound stopped working ran troubleshoot program and the pc doesn even acknowledge the headphones being plugged in with the jack looked online its very common problem ,1
i found one of these on the street back in the winter that had fallen off someone bike or car after unsuccessful attempts to find the owner ended up keeping it figured after being dropped and rained on it wouldn work but it did the sound is maybe not the best you could find but it not at all terrible if you want something rugged that you can take to the water this would be good speaker ,5
i was bit too busy with work and school and missed my window to return this item the quality of the mouse and usb plug is just horrible ordered the mouse with urgency to get power point project done for schooland had to run to local discount store to purchase another mouse because the usb piece fell apart and after careful putting it back together the mouse won connect over got about minutes of use fromthis product ,1

i was enjoying these headphones although they had some odd features like the dual cable that is excessively long the sound quality was pretty great for the price while it lasted but they made odd cracks and pops from time to time maybe from whatever issue caused them to stop working either way am not impressed and even if were to get another pair of headphones from this brand would not try anymore at this price point ,1
i was searching for bluetooth mouse found one but didn like the color when changed to the silver one some how it switched off of bluetooth it is wireless and did work with the usb dongle the buttons are quiet and the movement was smooth unfortunately have mac and the usb ports are only usb the mouse does come with an adapter but this makes it stick out far and will get damaged had to return it ,5

i was very excited about this keyboard but unfortunately it has been very bad experience in general it is as presented in the advertisement but after using it for minutes it stops working completely even when it is turned on tried reinstalling the drivers changing the usb port and trying it with another computer but did not get good results it does not work after few minutes am very disappointed that wasted my money on this product ,1
it fancy looking keyboard that doesn break your bank rgb lights are well illuminated and keys are ok too keys could be little noisy the biggest problem is you can use the left ctrl and shift buttons together even though the battery life is reasonable the keyboard doesn have proper battery indicator that tells you how much charge left so you might get frustrated when the keyboard suddenly decides to stop in the middle of the work ,5
it really nice headset was bit disappointed when found that the usb was only for the lights and that you needed the splitter for the pc sadly my laptop only has one jack so had to order another splitter just to use the new headset may have missed the description about all of that so it could be my fault it would have been nice though if the usb worked for both the lights and the headset ,5
love it came with the mouse itself white cable black usbc adapter the white little adapter underneath the mouse easily connected to the black usb that used for my macbook to usbc the white small cable believe to charge it you can easily turn off the lights but they look really nice on mouse is thin but comfortable although order the silver to match my laptop it is not the exact same but close just bit darker ,1

nice low silhouette and quiet action does what is expected of mouse and is good looking to boot obviously cannot judge it ergonomic qualities from such short term of usage but it appears to be no strain at all on my wrist and fingers holds charge well the only caveat might mention is that the dongle is bit too short for if you re using while charging but that is minor issue well pleased with this mouse ,5
ordered this for my new laptop works like charm includes charging cable adapter and usb receiver that can be stored in the bottom of the mouse the colors light up very nicely and customer support was lovely contacted them about activating warranty my only issue with this mouse is the shape which was more flat than the mice used to using but that is just personal preference and got used to it very quickly overall great product ,1

small lightweight yet firm solid feel led lighting is nice touch shuts off automatically once laptop or pc is shutdown however the main reason purchased was because of the silent feature sadly it not as silent as had hoped clicks are still audible especially on scroll wheel which is disappointing why cant someone make truly silent mouse have yet to find one as most silent mice are merely muffled by rubber lining shame would be perfect otherwise,1

so it has problems the biggest one was the move the cursor on it own like it just spazzes out could work with it didn mind it all that much besides it being real annoyance when gaming then it got more frequent and then the roller that scrolls broke and only had it for week or two so now got to replace it not great product looks nice but made cheap which suppose is why it is ,5
the keyboard is definitely quiet but the enter key is in an awkward position if you learned how to type and don hunt and peck you will constantly be hitting the slash key rather than the enter key this gets very frustrating when trying to type reports and documents it has nice look and my kids thought it was cool with the colors but sadly it was returned due to it not being practical for my needs,5
the keyboard looks and feels great but the issue is that at times while typing or using any keys really it just stops responding for good while this has lead me to charge it until the indicator turns off fully charged and it still does this ve turned off the wireless and connected via usb and this still happens so ultimately would not recommend this because you kinda need to use all the keys at all times ,1
the keyboard works wonders love how accurate and speedy it is and how it shuts off when not in use to save power in addition to that klim is such wonderful company with excellent customer service had misplaced my wireless dongle the little black usb piece that is for the keyboard and they were more than happy to send me new one at no extra charge they even included little french candy with my dongle love klim ,5
the mouse works fine it is slim kind of cheap plastic but the lights which in photos look like it would just be thin line around the mouse are very annoying the entire thing lights up you can not turn them off and still use the mouse it is very distracting did not try to return it because there is nothing else wrong but will donate it to charity or someone ordered another one with no lights ,1

the pairing between speakers is easily interrupted and interferes with they are constantly cutting out probably really only good for single speaker use and not pairing of them together as advertised everything else about this speaker is awesome through it in snowbank last weekend after having it for several months and it sounded great and continued working figured if the pairing sucked then would start testing out the other features they advertise water resistance was successful test ,1
the sound quality is great mic tested fine the quality of the materials seems bit cheap though the cushion for the top of the head was bit minimal the ear muffs were bit small and did not really provide sufficient room for your ears to be comfortably inside them my ears were aching hurting within hours of wearing the headphones if you re kid these will probably work out great for you an adult pass em up ,5
the speaker sounds amazing it looks amazing brought it to the beach the other day said it on the beach and went out into the water and could still hear it for quite ways my boyfriend has two that we have velcro mounted to our boat and honestly think two is too many because it is super loud but all around if you were looking for small portable loudspeaker this is exactly what you re looking for ,5
these headphones are very high quality for low price very sturdy and don feel cheap they hold onto your head very snug and don slip like alot of other headsets the sound quality is better than some high end headsets ve used and they cancel noise outside of the headset very well the cord is also very long so you re not restricted on how much you can move with them on as it is wired headset ,5
very disappointed with this keyboard do lot of office work and the ctrl shift doesn work on the left side of the keyboard did little research and it appears this is common issue you have to use ctrl shift on the right side which is so awkward will be returning this keyboard as am not happy with it on side note it is very quiet when type but the spacebar is much louder than the other keys ,5
does not work with the ps and they are not well made the ear ad came off almost right away and they don even work well with the computer in order to have sound you need mm jack which the ps does not have the usb seems to be power source for the brilliant blue lights don recommend these at all the lights are nice but not worth it since they don do what they should ,5
finally decided to buy portable speaker and not disappointed with my decision first time playing impressed me update after using the speaker for some time it not the best would recommend depends on the purpose the bt range is pretty incredible it gets the job done for being portable like others stated it mono with the two woofers battery seems to drain on me little quicker so make sure keep it charged after or during use ,5
fully charged would work with the mouse for hour minutes and then it would lag and hardly move or not move at all fully charged kept having to switch usb ports to get it working again which worked sometimes but then it again would get stuck lag or stop working have the latest mac software what don have is time for this mouse returned it bought another wireless usb mouse from another company that works perfectly ,1

honestly this product is super good especially for the price my brother has his own pair of gaming headphones they are different brand that cost about would say that this for lot cheaper sounds better and fits better than his if you needed one real fast would say buying this would be good option that what did was having problems in class with my mic so had to buy new headphones and this did the job ,5
i bought this mouse in april liked it lot for months for the last few weeks it has stopped tracking reliably and the battery dies within about half hour even if try to use it plugged into the computer it stops tracking and the lights dim can find any warranty information on it feel like it should have lasted more than months think ll buy wireless mouse with known brand name and hope for better luck ,1

i got these headphones to upgrade my cheap starter pair and have been using them to teach english online since january they have performed wonderfully can hear my students pronunciation very clearly my students have no trouble hearing or understanding me and am not dealing with headache after wearing them for five hours straight plus my chinese students think they look cool they ve been great investment and highly recommend them for other online esl teachers ,5
i got this mouse on thursday night only charged it for less than minutes not full charge and have been using it for days in row on the red light mode only thought it would run out of power in day or two but is still working nicely the mouse feels comfortable under my palm not too big or too small was ready to be disappointed for the price vs quality but so far so good ,1

i have been using the wireless mouse for weeks waited to write the review so could truly review it based on my experience it has not disappointed me and like everything about it charge it whenever remember to the design is sleek and the changing colors are soothing when take my eyes off the screen stare at the mouse the respond to clicks is smooth and quick can feel the clicks but not hear the clicks ,5

i have had this mouse for while now love it it perfect size and the color change is probably my favorite part don have to recharge it everyday but really only use it for work so work an hour day again it really doesn need to be charged often when it time for charge the color will start to shift to red everyone that seen it has asked where got it and that they want one ,1

i have used these headphones for multiple years am power user say remote worker with hours of meetings every day still can believe that they are so good for such an amazing price the cord is super long during meetings can get up and walk around noise cancellation is amazingly good they are comfortable they have volume control and mute control on the headphones themselves what more could you possibly want hope they sell these forever ,1
i like the feel and look of this mouse bought it as deal of the day really like how it changes colors and how smooth it feels also love that you can recharge it only dislike is that review and edit important documents for work and sometimes the cursor would move unexpectedly and will cause me to type something wasn trying to type ll have to undo whatever did other than that good price and quality ,1

i play games like world of tank blitz and fs that uses wasd to control lot the keyboard really helps me to reduce the load of the original laptop keyboard however this keyboard battery life is not so long that you need to charge probably every days if you play about hours averagely plus it is not so friendly in helping you talking through typing since the arrangement always makes me type out lots of typos ,1
i purchased for my kids to use while doing online class work it was easy to set up and seems to work well was hoping for something that felt more sturdy it feels very cheap the kids love the changing lights while they use the mouse my only complaint is that if they don remember to turn off the noise after use then it dies and has to be recharged before if can be used again,1
i purchased this months ago for work at home really like everything about the keyboard accept the letter quality as you can see by my picture within months the letters have started to rub off it has the backlight but it doesn matter because it lights the key and not the letter so you don know which key it is unless you have them memorized next time would pay bit more for double shot laser etched ,5
i so happy that purchased this mouse it sleek and it easy to use enjoy the light component it adds uniqueness the mouse is light weight the usb chip is easy to keep up with because it fits in small space underneath the mouse that way the chip never gets lost also like the idea that can charge the mouse and never have to worry about an internal battery malfunctioning highly recommend this mouse for purchase ,5
i very surprised by this speaker did lot of research ahead of time and decided on this one as it highly regarded ve heard several different bt speakers and none sounded this good extremely satisfied with the bass output it best if used few feet away from you as it sounds better had it outside last night during rainstorm it was basically getting misted on for hours but no ill effects you will not be dissatisfied ,5
i was used to buying name brand mouses and was worried about the size of this device but actually its good size just with lower profile works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top the lighting is nice not real bright but just strip around the outside and the button lights up changes color which is nice touch so actually like it better than the other larger mouses have ,1

i wasn looking to spend the amount of money did one this unit but really glad did even though it not the most ergonomic keyboard it serves its purpose and does exactly what need it to do not to mention that the lights which light up the letters very well make it easier to find some of the lesser known and used keys plus it uses the same usb charger that everything else uses win win ,1
it is quite nice it has an interesting style and the colored lights give it special touch unfortunately in terms of performance is lousy the sleep mode seems to fail constantly sometimes it turns off for no reason and stops working for while being fully charged so it must be damaged internally very disappointed with this product no matter how nice it is it is not worth buying if it does not fulfill its main function ,1

it pretty good when you are in the game and need to listen to your teammates talking but when it come to really needing good ear its noise cancellation feature comes bit short it does dampen the noises outside fairly well but not enough for certain games that need an attentive ear but otherwise if you were to use this for gaming it pretty darn good for multiplayer and also really good for single player games ,5
most think this will work on gaming console partially they will but how the console is designed there is no usb port next to an audio outlet there fore the player is left to choose between the lights on the earphones working or the audio working and we all know audio is must so all that is left is whats the point of the lights if you cant use em while gamethese are computer gaming earphones,5
my only real complaint is that every time you actually turn the switch off when you switch it back on it goes back to full lights that personal preference know but only turn the lights on occasionally you should also know that the positioning of the colors is not changeable they are on pulsing on off or off no ability to change any of the lights which is fine by me but might bother other people ,1
my son loves this headset it was his favorite birthday gift he uses it everyday to communicate with other online gamers this has been his only source of socializing with other kids since the pandemic started it quality headset for great price he has destroyed all other headsets but this one very satisfied with this purchase just know that it only lights up when playing on pc not xbox or playstation my son doesn care though ,5
not having to change the battery is what drew me to this but it goes to sleep to save power and is hard to get it working again thought the slim profile mouse would be ok and better for travel but it is too hard to hold thought it might just be my big hands and gave it to my wife she gave it back and said it was hard for her to hold on too ,5

sounds like gigantic speaker my daughter had one of these from amazon and loved it on her coffee table to use with tv across the room so bought it and was impressed when listening to my amazon downloaded music hubby heard it and bought himself the next version up to enhance his ipad music amazing sound from small unit we ve use it in the garage to practice our dance steps and the quality is excellent ,5
the mouse itself is nice but the usbc part does not fit into my surface nor does the usb part fit bought this because have new surface and needed usbc to usb connection so could use the mouse with the surface guess the specs are different in china had to go back and buy usbc so could use the mouse attached is picture of the one had to buy do not recommend unless you want project ,1
the sound quality on this is wonderful it is directional so it won do sound but music sounds beautiful with rich and full bass the battery life is fantastic perfect for an all night party or all day event it comes with the capability to charge any usb devices you may have it is little on the heavier side but still is portable enough to put in your backpack or basket on your bike very satisfied ,5
these are exactly what was looking for and got then half off as well would definitely recommend have seen that people were having issues with the mic on nintendo switch but it works for me it works for my pc nintendo switch and even my phone the price is cheap but the quality is high they are also very comfortable hate using headphones but these gaming headphones are great for just about everything stars hands down ,5
this is great keyboard for the price the keys are mushy it not particularly comfortable and it runs out of battery more quickly than like but it water proof consistent and inexpensive if you re someone like me who has history of drowning expensive keyboards in water look no further ve already tried to ruin this keyboard couple of times but quick wipe down and it keeps chugging along this is tremendous keyboard for the price ,1
this is great speaker light and easy to work basic controls that get the job done with no confusion ordered carry strap for it from amazon as well must get the carry strap for hanging and protection gave it out of for sound quality it delivers more bass than treble great speaker for the money claims to have hr battery based on use and is waterproof can touch that plenty loud for the beach or backyard,1
this is very nice headset for ps the only complaint have is that it only lights up when the usb is plugged in which can be difficult when you already have stuff for gaming plugged in the sound works great being plugged into controller overall it has worked great and my son likes it would not suggest buying based on lighting up unless you have an extra usb slot to plug it into usb on ps ,5
this keyboard is great for gaming but when got this it came with downside is that my space bar was squeaky not too loud but definitely noticeable but later down the road with the keyboard it just recommendation to the product is at red light for the battery light so you can tell if it is low cause could be gaming and it does with no sort of warning but overall great product it works amazing,1
unfortunately missed the return window by less than month do lot of panning around for my work with the middle scroll wheel button and the button has issues about half the time where it doesn register that clicked or gets stuck it cute but wouldn buy it again update just wrote this review couple days ago the scroll wheel just broke fully no more intermittent use use it lot but bought it literally two months ago ,5

works great it little too small and would stress my hand if used it all day everyday but don so keeping it and am content to be more specific the buttons are not directly below my fingertips which would be solved by longer mouse or an ergonomic one that has little more height to it an averaged sized male and to my knowledge my hand is typical of that size of person haha hope this helps ,1

bought this because it was suggested for its comfort it said people with larger heads could wear it without the infamous head pinch was snug fit for me felt the pinch and the ear cups were too small was going to disregard it since it was fairly cheap but then tested it out one of the headphones didn work and yeah made sure it wasn on mono the the and were on and balanced returned ,5
good for my wireless gaming setup needed ergonomic rests to use it though but it is good keyboard with good rgb lights but do wish sometimes that the lights stayed on hard to see the keys in my dark room sometimes when get ready to use it gotta click the wrong key to turn it back on to see which is right but other than that good response time battery life and all would recommend,5
i had high hopes due to all the positive reviews but this mouse became virtually useless after just weeks would move the mouse on the mouse pad back and forth and it would barely move on the screen every task on the computer began to take the amount of time it used to had to resort to using the trackpad on my macbook which not fan of definitely don get this mouse not worth it ,1

i literally have complaints use this at work at half volume both the kitchen work in and the kitchen connected to mine can hear the music the reason we put it at half volume is because at full volume you can hear it all the way throughout the lobby from the back door of the kitchen even over all the sounds of the ovens timers and customers talking hands down would recommend this to anyone ,5
i mean this is wireless mouse that has pretty lights and stuff but swear it doesn catch well and have to slide it like pro curler either it dies really fast or it just decides to stop properly working not sure what the true issue is like the texture and how sleek it is but when it doesn properly work it drives me absolutely nuts even got mouse pad and it still gives me issues ,5
i plugged it in and let it charge over night was so excited to use it becuae though it was so cute did not work from day when turned the power on it would flash red then would try to use it and nothing zero zip nothing would work waste of time buying it waste of time trying to get it to work and now waste of time having to return it so very disappointed,1

i received the keyboard with defective dongle had talk to the customer service about it and they were very nice and helpful received new one few weeks later and the new one doesnt work either looked up how to sync it with the keyboard and after many attempts it just wont work sad because the keyboard looks cool and would very much like to use it maybe it just my luck of getting defective receivers ,1
i surprised how highly rated this keyboard is given that the space bar isn quiet as advertised this isn manufacturing defect it the actual design besides that problem the enter key is whole key further away compared to most keyboards found myself repeatedly pressing where the key should be but that place is occupied by the backslash another problem is that in ubuntu the keyboard shortcut for create new folder doesn work on this keyboard ,1
i was extremely disappointed to find out the charging adapter didn come with this speaker it expensive enough you think they include like they did for my charge got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and one of the things he loved about the aesthetics of my charge was the vibrant charger an adapter is something of users will need why omit that great quality but give this star for skimping on the charger ,5
i would not recommend this product at all it cheap for reason it rarely works while it looks nice its performance is very poor in each box they ll include little flier saying you ve won free product to receive it you need to leave good review while they do indeed follow through and give you the product it harmless scam to get positive reviews for their bad products spend the money on better product ,5
it great the only reason didn give stars is because the lights go off almost as soon as you stop typing understand that it has an energy saver to keep you from constantly recharging it but seconds would have been perfect you barely can enjoy the effects as far as being loud it not loud to me don what kind of silent vortex these other people need to be in but it quiet enough keyboard ,1
maybe this is just personal preference but the single offset speaker is very distracting if you hold it in front of you you can immediately notice that there no sound coming from the left side initially thought maybe mine was defective as why would such an expensive device be mono did more research and learned it was designed that way the sound quality is still excellent just personally can look past the unequal sound distribution ,5
mouse seems to work ok looks nice easy install etc biggest complaint is the time out and wake up feature every time go to use the pc it asleep then have to either click button which may may not cause an action on the pc or pick it up and down several times too annoying so stopped using it might keep it aside for use with my laptop when traveling definitely not for daily use ,5

overall liked the feel and responsiveness but the durability was the big issue this mouse was for work computer with light everyday use and within less than two months it would no longer charge or work properly took it apart to verify the battery was making connection and even replaced the battery however the mouse still would not track properly perhaps just got dud but decided to spend few more dollars and purchase different brand ,5
product looks as described and is comfortable however two main features are gonna mark this one as return for me the sound quality is bad for both the incoming and outgoing mic audio everything sounds echoey like its in fish bowl also the mute function does not work game audio itself is fine but not great but got these for chatting and wont be able to use it this way pay more get more suppose ,1
since live in the remote rainforest always keep backups of necessary items like keyboards bought this keyboard several months ago and stored it in it original packaging until needed it two days ago my current keyboard malfunctioned so got this one out of the box to use and the key mostly doesn work at all or it puts double or triple letters am now stuck for about month until can get new one very disappointed ,5
the headset is very comfy in general and it fits on my head you re able to extend it and it pretty good the noise cancellation could be better but it still works the mic is little too short and the mic could be better the sound quality is very good but am unsure how good it is compared to other headsets it is good nonetheless and would recommend it very good for its price,5
the mouse seemed nice when got it and has great feel in your hand with quiet clicks however after weeks of every other day use the scroll wheel stopped working returned it for replacement and now weeks after receiving the replacement that scroll wheel has also stopped working because the original purchase was outside the return window return was not possible would not buy again and am going with different product from different seller manufacturer ,1

the speaker was for my husband motorcycle he able to put it on his motorcycle ride with it bluetooth connection real easy for him the sound of the speakers very loud he very happy with it easy for him to set up and he was able to charge it without taking it off his motorcycle so that even better plus it waterproof he loves it and we will definitely buy it again two thumbs up,5
this is really good bang for your buck you are getting what your paying for then more the keys are little ristricting for complex games crafting survival inventory management but for fps and others it is really great even with those more complex games it works when use it and hour or two day it last for about days don even turn the power switch off it sleeps really efficiently over all well rounded keyboard ,5
this mouse is wonderful and easy to use without mouse pad which is big plus bought this to replace my old wireless mouse because the usb plug is shorter and does stick out the side of my laptop to far it is rechargeable and lasts for while thanks to the sleep function which is easy to exit from love that you can choose to have it light up and changes colors totally worth the buy ,1

works and the battery lasts week or two with frequent use and charges easily one less cord to get snarled in my laptop case too the lights around the edge seem silly but do make it easy to keep track of it in the dark goes to sleep after few minutes of nonuse requires mouse click to wake it up nuisance but that means you need not bother to turn it off overall very pleased ,5

 the ergonomic feel of the mouse is great and the battery life is amazing it is lightweight and feels cheap white matches my setup but it translucent and takes way from the aesthetic it is connected less than ft away and it still loses connectivity which causes it to lag it makes it completely useless to me don recommend you buy it at least not the white one and be aware of the lagging ,5

bought these for my son as birthday gift and was so disappointed when he realized they did not work at all the first bad review left was deleted when the company promised gift card if we would delete it we deleted the review and never received the gift card so here is the second bad review they are terrible they do not work and the quality of material feels very fragile would not recommend ,5
cannot go wrong for the price buttons are totally silent and feel solid same with the scroll wheel not gaming most but ve had no problems with accuracy comes with slim usb port and pretty large usb port but it allows for usb passthrough which is neat can speak to battery life yet but it seems to have great power saving features so easily recharge with micro usb note this does not have bluetooth ,5

i didn like the way the light shown thru the top like the plastic was super thin and semi transparent and it didn come thru evenly have been using it for while now and it sometimes gives me trouble have to tap the bottom to get the red light back on and the wheel stops working sometimes just unplug usb and plug back in fixes it still stars because at this price it great ,5

i found this mouse to be too small for my hand and not large person by any means it might work for child but found that my thumb kept blocking the left button changing lighting was just distracting although might have become used to it if could actually get the left mouse button to work it is also too flat for good ergonomics hand at rest is normally more arched than this mouse allows ,1
i got this in june and it now the end of september it was great at first and lasted multiple days on charge but now the battery dies after just couple of hours and it dies randomly without any warning so it always in the middle of using it frustrating this lasted maybe months in totalupdate again month later this is dead and battery lasts few minutes at most even after charging up fully,1
i just needed wireless mouse for at work because was sick of the cord the company issued mouse had the color is bright and the lights are nice subtle change to working they re pretty the only thing hate is that have to bounce it on the mousepad to wake it up nothing major but the sensor could be better it not overwhelmingly wonderful but it cute and is good value considering the cost ,1
i purchased this mouse because needed new one for my work from home station came across this mouse and read some of the reviews and thought would take chance on it it has turned out to be one of the best things have purchased from amazon it is such smooth operating mouse and the color displays on it are really fun definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in search of wireless mouse ,1

i use this keyboard for my ps as play mostly at night and needed quieter way to play online with people this does just the trick and is just more comfortable and quicker for me to type on than those tiny keyboard attachments for controllers my only small complaint as others have mentioned is some colored keys are easier to see than others but overall it hasn been significant issue and serves its purpose ,5
i ve never had to charge it for the few weeks used it the lights cant change dont think but it doesnt matter to me the wireless range is good enough as well keys feel nice it sleeps when idle and find the wakeup very responsive havent had any issues with this havent really used the various function keys and never gamed with it use controller anyway but for what do it works perfectly ,5
i was so happy with this mouse when first got it very comfortable loved the light and most of all the wireless feature the love affair however was short lived after using the mouse for only months it stopped working would charge it it would run for minutes then dead again it got to the point that the only way the mouse would work is if kept it plugged therefore defeating the wireless feature ,1
it nice it lights up has good feel while in your hand stayed charged for good bit after the st charge however after it died the first time it doesn hold charge for very long now its not bad for someone who doesn use it daily constantly using my computer so it dying after days use is pain and don have time to let it charge for forever went back to using battery mouse ,1
it very worth the prime day sale price and nearly worth retail selling price sound quality is very nice and can hear low frequency bass very well very easy to connect to and doubles as power bank if you need to charge your phone have not tested the water resistance but many others have look up videos testing it recommend this over other speakers in its price range but definitely get case for it ,5
my neighbor had this version of bluetooth speaker and bought one for myself to listen to tunes while sitting at my desk my coworkers love how it sounds it reception range the clarity without any distortion and it motivated one coworker to buy one for himself the battery stays charged for quite long time honestly can remember when charged it last but it was over weeks ago this is an item that doesn disappoint ,1
my son loves the keyboard as an extension of his school laptop he thinks the colors are cool and the ease of use is great we had slight problem with charging and contacted the company real person responded to my inquiry very quickly their solution was efficient and thoughtful and my son was back to using his keyboard in week this was good purchase made better by the good customer service that backs it ,5
ok my trackball that ve had for years is dying so went back to the mouse you can spend over on mouse but unless you are hardcore gamer and even then probably not worth it to be honest so went with this affordable mouse totally works it is very thin think would have liked little more meat on it maybe even for it to be big heavier but it so it worth it recommend ,5
ok so am not super tech person and am not sure if this is fixable problem or not but only one side of the headphones work that was the whole reason on buying another pair of headphones because my first pair of different brand started to break and lose hearing in one side just opened mine and yet it has the same problem other than that they seem great just wished mine worked know ,5
ordered these in october and the left ear stereo is now gone ve had other headphones that have lasted longer then this will not be purchasing these again update company got ahold of me sent brand new set gonna change the score based on the customer service alone but we will see how long these lasts will update the review accordingly if you do get them get warranty you ll need it before long ,1
product worked great for st months now the usb charging port is bad and since it rechargable mouse it useless now led lights were cool and the mouse felt great ergonomically with soft quiet clicks being optical vs laser it isn for gaming and battery wouldn last all day clicking it also went into sleep mode too quickly and having to click without knowing where the arrow to turn it on turned into hassle ,1

the cord is way too long it and it gets tangled up because it is so long and sometimes it cuts out so can only hear in one ear and have to fiddle with the cord to try and fix it the mic cancels most noise but the headset does not cancel any noise and since have fan on can hear it with my headset on and it gets annoying while trying to game ,1
the headsets volume is terrible and the people you play with will barely be able to hear you even if you max the output volume on it the sound quality is also terrible as it randomly amplifies certain sounds and makes everyone sound like they are talking into cup overall dont buy this even though its cheap it is not worth as you wont be able to even function with this hunk of junk ,5
the quality was great and everything worked fine it was very easy to use but it only worked for about months until the mic stopped working it seems others had the same issue as well not too bad for price though edit the microphone started to work again it occasionally gets spotty and my audio can sound muffled to others but that not all the time the speakers still work great can hear clearly ,5
the usb receiver got stuck in my laptop usb port ended up having to get it out with pliers fortunately this didnt cause any damage to the usb port very disappointed in this product as the keyboard no longer works at all and it almost damaged my laptop the usb receiver came out in pieces at time and not sure if it even functioned properly to begin with it most definitely doesn function now ,1
these headphones are amazing and love them so much the noise cancelation is okay it works but its not as perfect as thought it would be they are comfortable but they do not connect to my android phone the headphones only light up when you plug them into the spot where plug in my mouse so was bit disappointed about that but other than that they are super comfortable and love them so much ,5
this mouse has been so much better on my wrists it sleek new design makes it easier to sit all day without the need to move to another position to relieve the strain on my wrist love the rechargeable aspect because no longer need to struggle with the endless supply of battery replacements it is so easy to sync up and was ready to go right away so many colors to choose from too ,5

this mouse is good quality for low price love the multi colored led lights on the side and middle chose the blue and feel like it adds pop of color to my office however the blue paint is already peeling on the bottom and ve only used it little while not sure if it came like that or is already wearing there are probably other products for similar price that could be better quality ,1

this mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box it will move the cursor around and scroll but it will not click on anything right or left click ridiculous want to return it but the hassle of dealing with it isn worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with should have known to go for more expensive and reputable brand like logitech ,5

this product is perfect am just using it as regular keyboard for my laptop but my gaming buddy immediately picked it up and was checking it out he seemed impressed with it and that was enough to have me sold on it the lights are great the keys feel perfect for typing as far as spacing goes the wireless is nice touch as well excited for years of use to come from this thing ,5
 its an okay mouse disliked how cheap it appears because the rose gold color got was light spray on top and there are distinct areas where the light is shining through also disappointed that when turn the color changing led off but keep the mouse on that its constant red color which was not in the description it also goes into sleep mode quickly and takes good seconds to reconnect which is frustrating ,5
 original review for this price they re pretty good they aren noise cancelling but around the speakers in the headphones are great the microphone isn great though was told sounded like was speaking into plastic cup within the first two weeks the headphones no longer light up and the mic doesn work customer service never returns any emails even though ve sent to them very disappointed will never buy from these people again ,5
 this is great gaming headset for xbox it has very good noise cancellation my son really liked the blue lights but just heads up as someother reviewers have stated the blue light only turns on when connected to laptop or pc because you need to insert the usb cable in my son doesn seem to mind it while playing xbox though he loves his new gaming headset great customer support from bengoo too ,5
after hours of youtube reviews and black friday cyber sale decided to go with this large awkward speaker with only decent battery life and ok sound quality know now for fact that the bose is way better the charge distorts at about of max volume and doesnt have the bass like that of smaller devices just because you add some flexy vibrating cones on the ends doesnt mean there will be better bass ,1
alot of people said the mouse was loud didnt work or what ever else its false the mouse is super quiet my mouse at work is loud and obnoxious this isnt the colors are great was sad cause it didnt turn pink lol but that is my only complaint its great mouse some of yall expect way too much from something cheep you get what you pay for but this mouse is great ,5

as far as portable bt speakers go it does the job music comes out sounds pretty clear and is loud enough for small outdoor area keep of these by the pool on each side and link them together with stereo sound good way to have music in the pool area without having to wire speakers and such thinking about getting more in order to cover more area but these will do for now ,1
garbage bought my niece new hp for college plugging the usb in laptop mouse cause the laptop not to work mouse moves really slow or don move at all thinking it was the laptop took the laptop back got brand new one same issue but when took the ian out and used my store bough best buy mouse works perfect no problems be careful with this mouse and plugging it into your laptops ,5
got this mouse for my desktop setup which mainly use for office purposes and it has been working great it replaced cheaper version than this one that got at below of which did not expect much but got me going for years don think would recommend for gaming since is little on the small side and somewhat flat but who knows is it very responsive thought and looks nice with the changing colors ,1

i bought one of these last year for one of my laptops and loved it so when the other mouses mice meeces whatever went bought more they are quiet and very easy to use this time forgot that the one usb connector was on the bottom so was ready to send back and exchange it but when went to pack it up saw it on the bottom thank goodness because really like them ,5
i bought this keyboard twice once months ago and again few weeks ago have two computers one for work and one for personal use both times when moved the usb port from one computer to another received an error and my computer did not recognize the usb tried the internal usb ports along with the hubs have for each computer do not make the mistake made do not give this product first chance ,1
i got this keyboard because my computer is not under direct light and at night it difficult or impossible to see what you re typing can use this in the dark and it only stays lit when in use so it not glowing all day long the rainbow colors are pretty only wish it had volume button you can push fn function but would have liked just and up down mute feature somewhere ,5
i gotten mouse mouse pad combo at tj maxx but there was no usb to connect it to my laptop so ordered this online it was good price and shipped quickly and am so glad ordered it it way cooler than the other one bought and feels like it made better it lights up there an on off and sleep mode to preserve battery also works so seamlessly and smooth great product thanks ,5

i had ordered these to replace my headset that went out and will admit these worked amazingly as console gamer it was tad frustrating that the cable split isnt longer but to be honest it doesnt even bother me now use it for when streaming on my pc and it perfect for it the mic quality is better than expected and the lights look really nice also you really cant beat the price ,5
i like that you have the option to have the lights pulse in and out or keep it solid the keyboard does go dark if you don touch the keys energy efficient say the best part is how quiet the keys are definitely worth the price update lost the usb receiver for the keyboard and contacted klim directly they sent me new usb receiver for free amazing customer service from this company recommend ,5
i like this speaker crisp clear sound with nice bass the only misleading part for me was the hr playtime after hours on moderate volume it was down to the nd to last light and it also says you can have something charging as well thru the usb highly doubt would have lot of battery in doing so nothing different in battery longevity compared to my other non jbl speakers except better sound ,1
i love my new keyboard love that the keys are not flat the best part is they light up it makes typing so much easier those that complain about the space bar being loud it isn if you hit it in the middle have had no issues and my typing is way better than the flat one was using it is very comfortable to type and doesn take up lot of space perfect ,1
i only bought this for the silent keys have newborn baby and needed silent clicks but this keyboard was more loud than my current gaming keyboard if you need reviews on anything else please read elsewhere didn even connect it simply started typing and was disappointed stars being generousmaybe the company is comparing their keys to mechanical stroke keyboard if that were the case then every keyboard would be silent compared to those ,5
i purchased this as an admittedly cheap headset just have something to use until could afford better one and within weeks of owning it the headset stopped working would not be detected at all by any of my pcs had amazon replace it with another one and that nd one failed the exact same way less than hours later unreal would advise anyone looking for headset to look elsewhere terrible cheap awful product ,1
i really needed mouse because it is so much easier when working from my laptop searched on amazon and came across this vibrant mouse fell in love and decided to buy it it was the best decision because this mouse is fantastic and works perfectly love the color variations and the sleek look it is easy to setup use and also easy to charge it is also wireless which makes it even better ,1

i super love this jbl speaker my uncle had bought speaker not this one and it cost him and it was bigger than this one supposedly it one of the best brands and honestly it as loud as my uncle and this was cheap use the speakers almost every day and it lasts almost like days and half sometimes three and it charges pretty fast don regret buying this speaker super love it ,5
i waited while to leave review tought it would last but it didn it was really smooth and long lasting battery little did know while using it it would become apart internally the scrollwheel broke usually fix my electronics easily sometimes things just need little adjustment but this part broke and with no fixing maybe some of you are lucky and doesn break easily mine did and not even weeks of using it ,1

i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the headphones for the price that they were they are very comfortable to wear and the mic is placed at good distance from your mouth so people can only hear you when you want them too not experienced enough in the gaming equipment world but the quality of sound is great for me too if you want cheap reliable headset would highly recommend this one ,5
just got the item today everything works out great but the usb could not fit into the adapter neither could any other usb as seen in the picture they all try to go in sideways and thats why they wont fit so even though the product works just fine am unable to use it which is why its three star regardless if you have normal usb ports this product will work just fine ,1

love the speaker sound quality is good however we have had the hardest time the speaker willpower off and then somehow power itself back on it randomly turns on and you randomly connect to it tried customer service but couldn get anyone on the phone who could hear me clearly or understand english now have speaker have to keep plugged in and disconnect and turn off blue tooth or it just automatically connects ,5
ok clearly this device is not an audiophile one arguably no bluetooth device is guess but really the high end is very lacking almost muffled sounding the low end is decent for device this size but it depends on where and how you position it against wall or corner tends to resonate better and gives better bass placed on the floor does the same and as others pointed out this is mono device ,5
so the blue light won work unless you plug into additional usb power device kind of lame mean year old kid was sad as it showed them blue but guess my fault not reading more should just be battery would last forever being ledanyways it tried them on and they do block some noise the sound is pretty good he loves them would recommend as they are cheap and haven tried anything else ,5
st off this product advertises as if there are lights on it there aren its just sticker that doesn have any led function very misleading nd the headset is very poorly made the earpieces barely fit my year old they are far too small to fit an adults ears rd the sound quality is subpar takes lot of adjustment and you get better quality from an xbox default headset do not buy this ,1
the jbl is really good speaker it surpasses my expectations and it has great sound quality with phone settings you can switch up the sound to your satisfaction am impressed with the tracking too love this product and will continue to use amazon for most purchases overall would absolutely recommend this product to others but make sure you have the right charger and buy case for it so it easy to carry around,5
the mic is easy to use and have good mic quality my friends say that they don hear any static or background noises the earpad are very comfortable on my ears though so if you have sensitive ears the headphones wont be an issues the sound is good quality which is need for games like apex and cod in conclusion good headphones for the price and will definitely buy again in the future ,5
the mouse itself still works but the usb port has just broken in million pieces my laptop stays at home and it is what use as my home computer after about month of use the usb port is just the piece that pushes into the laptop and the plastic tip is just gone one more break and it will either be stuck in my computer or will be unable to use the mouse ,5

the mouse seems to work fine and looks nice but arrived very dirty the box being dirty can understand due to shipping but the mouse itself has lint few pieces of pet hair and the track scroll is dirty as if it been used lot it was not described as used but very much appears to be and upset to pay full price for something that has definitely been out of the box ,1

the overall audio is really good but you can only hear from one side of the headphone and every often you can hear static noise that is coming from the headset and the only way you can fix it is by unplugging and plugging back in and know that not exactly you know annoying or an inconvenience but it is kind of annoying to you know having to unplug and plug back in,5
the price of this mouse was cheap and you will get just that with this product it serves its purpose ok like the color changing led lights but this mouse is too lightweight for my liking and my hand is too big to fit on the mouse comfortably it feels like there is lag when moving the arrow just an overall not great feel compared to my mouse on my work office computer ,5

this is an awesome mouse it is slender build so it fits small hand the lights are totally fun when you click the buttons it is strong click so that you know you have clicked on something it also has quick response on the computer it has an off on switch plus an automatic shut off so you won use up the batteries will be buying one for my daughter it is awesome ,5

this mouse feels great in your hands you don have to worry about it being difficult to click or scroll as the placement of the buttons are all easy to use and find it also really does light up in different colors it also has setting where you can turn off the light and still use the mouse it is rechargeable through usb and the battery seems to last while overall pretty good ,5
this mouse would not connect to my compute despite multiple attempts following the instructions given as is typical of many amazon products this product is cheaply made and not worth wasting your money on would suggest avoiding making purchases from this brand in the future and strongly suggest not buying this mouse unless throwing money away on broken pieces of junk that don work is past time of yours then knock yourself out ,1

this unit pumps out enough base to fill my patio or job site the battery lasts forever charges quickly enough and sound quality is solid the sound is bit on the warm side but easily adjusted with my phone equalizer will definitely be getting another if it ever dies we have dropped this thing and left it outside few times more than should admit but it just keeps on performing it is awesome ,1
this was an awesome wireless keyboard then after charging it twice it would not charge on the third time thought got dud so got second one same thing happened wish they would charge because they where great keyboards and yes they where on surge protector but as soon as they key board died and put them on the charger no charging light tried few outlets and keep it on over night and nothing ,5
this would be star but in order to use light on headphones you have to plug it in that wouldn be bad but the cord to plug it into ur xbox is super short you would have to latterly but on top of the system to use it other than that they are fine don buy this for the light because they probably won be close enough to the tv to use it ,5
we needed wireless keyboard quickly and this keyboard from klim could not be better find the colors are fun and the keyboard has full keys that are quiet and responsive it takes up less space than our old model and so far it has been working really well make sure you take look at the booklet that comes with the keyboard it fun read about the company and the people who founded it ,1
while absolutely love the product it the customer service that stands out the most when had issues with my keyboard this company was more than willing to help me out they went above and beyond to make sure was happy and had my keyboard working the keyboard is beautiful and waterproof which is important because use it in my kindergarten classroom am thrilled with the customer service and the products from this company ,5
within minutes of plugging the new rechargeable mouse into usb hub charger thankfully it wasn plugged into my daughter brand new laptop she just opened for her birthday my house started to smell like smoke and found the charging cable melting to the mouse in the drawer just put them in to pre charge if this had happened at night my house would have probably caught fire do not buy fire hazard dangerous,5

works as advertised and looks great little bulky for my tastes but it does its job note as others mentioned the wording on the headset itself is different than in the picture displayed but it is the same model would star it if it was little more comfy for long hours of use but after an hour or two because of its weight and bulk it really starts to become uncomfortable for me ,1
 updated review edited the review because the company responded to their marketing promotion after while just gave it to my nephew few days ago and he really likes it bought this headset for my nephew for his gaming purpose did test if it works and am impressed with the quality for this price my gosh and it looks so cool in blue my nephew is gonna love it totally recommend the product ,5
for this headset you have to constantly push the mouth piece as close to your mouth as possible which doesn really work well because the mic piece itself is plastic and when you are gaming you can constantly have hand holding the mic when need that hand for the game extreme caution when buying this it sound is good by itself but the mic part is awful will not be purchasing again ,5
i bought this because it was rechargeable and for the ergonomic design after using it for awhile plugged it in charged it worked for awhile then it would only work for few hours then not at all when plugged it in noticed that had to move the connection where it plugs into the device to the left then it would light up but if let go nothing would not recommend this product ,5

i bought this mouse to replace an older one that had just cracked love the feature of charging them by usb in place of batteries so much more convenient easy to setup mouse clicks are completely silent which is also nice feature the changing led color light on the inside is just bonus that makes it looks cool comfortable use slim design and really like the no slip material of the mouse ,1

i got this product days ago and everything was working great until wanted to use my mouse for different computer only to find out that the casing for drive was stuck in my computer and has no rendered both that usb port and my mouse useless the mouse is great in use but now cant use the mouse or the port until can find strong enough tweezers to get the piece out ,5
i had jbl portable speaker like this and it developed problems after months well past the warranty the company offered me off coupon on the purchase of my next one but unfortunately it still came out more cost effective to buy new one from amazon so bought from amazon great sound easy to charge can knock it just wish company would have replaced it for less than the projected cost for me ,5
i like the headphones unfortunately the wire was too short for the lights to be plugged in to the usb port and the controller on my ps the usb plugin for the lights was about long and the rest of the cord was longer but the sound was great do have to keep one side off my ear because need to be able to hear other things in the house definitely comfortable ,5
i liked it until it died after month contacted klim they had me run some tests they deciedef to replace it or give me refund when responed found their email address not good tried several times over several days with different emails same thing it even came back using their email tool on their webpage contacted amazon they gave me refund amazon was great about it dont know what happened to klim ,5
i purchased this keyboard in may and it now july use this keyboard for gaming so do use it quite bit which is why purchased it in the first place going off the reviews already having keys stick not working which shouldn be happening since ve only had it for less than months it worked great up until this last week but guess going to have to look into another keyboard now ,1
i took chance and bought this headset cause of the many good reviews but it by far the worst headset ever gamed with walmart headset was better then this crap it hurts my ears there only sound from the left side the right doesn have any sound at all and it extremely loud and staticky and if lower volume to try to hear people better in the game it just goes mute ,1
if your buy it to play in the dark like did it is worthless put it back in the box use steering wheel and button box so don use key keyboard all the time but when need to have to turn light on to see what key to hit send it back if could and get one that stays lit until turn it off useless to me for playing in the dark ,5
jbl xtreme has better sound quality and would be tons better than two of these in stereo unless you re going for stereo image two of these wouldn be bad for the money though you ll have worse quality audio if money isn an issue two xtreme in stereo is the best option you cannot use flip with charge to use stereo speakers need to be the same to utilize stereo mode ,5
looks great feels great unfortunately doesn completely work while some keyboard shortcuts work many are missing the biggest omission for me was ctrl who doesn use the save shortcut literally use it every few minutes as working checked the reviews before purchasing and chalked it up to user error but nope you literally can use the save shortcut that dealbreaker for me do not recommend this keyboard if efficiency is your thing ,1
my favorite thing about this mouse is how smooth it feels to the touch the colors are great addition and add to the experience of using it it feels sleek as you move it on mousepad and all other surfaces and textures the customer service has been splendid they replaced mouse for me and helped answer questions when inquired about getting replacement usb receiver they were pleasure to communicate with no complaints,5

my first concern is that it does not give you warning when it needs recharging it just dies out if you are using your usb for something else you have to stop what you are doing to plug in the mouse second the charge does not last long very frustrating and now the most important it died just stopped working oh well so much for fancy going back to battery operated mouse ,5

my office desk has slide out tray for the keyboard and this keyboard is perfect for that because of its slim design there is no wasted space had to replace more expensive keyboard for that reason and actually like this one much better the only complaint have is that the caps lock key is apparently where my fingers and brain feel like the shift key should be hopefully will adjust to that ,5
not only does this feel like the cheapest mouse have ever had the displeasure of holding the usb type adapter is loose fitting piece of junk not even worth the hassle of returning this piece of garbage only flashes red for second then quits doing anything else even after being charged for hours have attached it to different devices and nothing guess you get what you pay for and this instance junk,1

nothing special about this keyboard not fond of the manufacturers website adding to this review after less than year of use the battery is failing one of the issues is the forced keyboard lighting there is no way to turn it off while the keyboard saw heavy use the main function wireless is hampered by poor design am reducing my review to reflect this issue after testing do not recommend this product ,5
really like the quietness of the clicks flatter than most mice took little bit of getting used to but fine now will be easy to travel with very responsive charges by usb and lasts for several days no need to have extra batteries led lights are fun but hard to see in bright light looking at the screen when using the mouse who doesn so don really see the lights that much ,5

some reviews says these headphones are better than ones no they are not have sony studio monitor mdr to compare with specs shows hz to khz not even close to khz sound like from metal barrel without high frequencies and with over boosted bass can not turn off led light there is thing like button on sound control box thought it should be led switch button it is not button at all ,5
this is great standalone bluetooth speaker unfortunately jbl connect is wildly unpredictable so if you want to connect multiple compatible jbl speakers using this technology you will experience lots of dropouts of one or the other of the speakers it very frustrating otherwise the sound is great battery life is superb etc use it while camping quite lot and it gets me through multiple days of normal use without even considering recharge ,5
this is my second jbl speaker and the first one lasted me almost years with no issues so far this one works pretty well and has good sound quality every once and while the bt won automatically connect and have to manually do it the battery life is good usually listen to music as get ready for work in the mornings and it lasts three weeks doing that before it needs recharge ,5
this is the best wireless keyboard ve ever bought know ppl complain about slow response of the keyboard but if you change the settings for it you ll get better results my boys play games on my laptop and this keyboard responds quickly to all the commands required to play the games amazing keyboard for an affordable price love the colors love the fact you can change the intensity of the glow ,5
this product worked fine for few months but now they arent working you can hear other good but guess the mic is crap because the other people can her you talking even with the mic turned all the way up gave them to child for christmas and with in months they aren working and he complained the whole time that the other kids can hear him will not make this purchase again ,5
this was great find for me have an ergonomic computer desk that raises to standing as needed the keyboard drawer is not wide and other keyboards hung out the back and front this one fits fine and still feels like as it is regular keyboard like the indicator lights caps numlock etc are well lit when on and the technicolor backlighting is nice to see and let me know everything is working ,1
very excited for the speaker bought it to have on weekend camping trip but didn realize it was going to come without full charger left me unable to charge it as my other charger doesn disconnect into block and cord it stays as one now have to buy wall block in order to charge this speaker already spend lot of money on seems like real cheap way to save money as company ,5
welll it gonna be no from me it not very loud at all it was kind of disappointment compared to other cheaper bluetooth speakers had battery life it lasted maybe hours on full battery charge which is also disappointment as far as bluetooth connectivity had no issues connecting it to my phone which guess is the only good thing can say about it it definitely would not recommend just my two cents ,5
when this stops working looks like you re stuck no offer on replacement just purchased and already busted do not buy seriously not bot real review don listen to the star reviews not noise cancelling mic doesn work not even good sound quality well only bright side is if you write bad review then they ll refund you this is the only reason moved this from star to still don recommend purchasing,5
wow what great keyboard that makes typing fun keys are well spaced if you use shortcuts frequently this will really help does not feel cheap at all the construction is top notch and the key sound is an elegant clicky pump sound as far as can tell rgb color pattern is the only color choice but many ways to tune the back lighting effect to your taste super happy with the purchase ,1
 months later my keyboard just stopped working as was typing thought it needed to be charged but even after charging it would not turn on after many attempts to get it going again by turning it off and on it would work bur for few minutes and then go all dark and become unresponsive would have rated it high as it was excellent when it worked but now it is useless ,1
 the black feels super soft just plugged it into my usb on my computer it also comes with usb adapter incase you don have that left and right button clicks softy not annoyingly middle scroll works great the click is bit louder and it won click onto document so that click that doesn do anything happy with this purchase it looks great at night and it such gamer music producer look ,1

after removing the new headphones from package we noticed defective area in the wire fortunately the headphones are working properly just hope it doesn continue to unwind my yr son really likes it for gaming and says its great sound quality comfortable cool and stylish however it does slide off his head and he has to keep readjusting but that doesn seem to bother him gave it stars due to defect ,1
after using game controller which was touchy and took forever to enter search information sprung for this great looking and easy to use keyboard the backlit feature is must and it paired perfectly with an xbox one console charging was snap and it just what you need if you re doing lot of searches on your preferred streaming services would be helpful if the instructions included more information on key functions ,5
after years of heavy use one of the speakers finally blew ve really put this thing through the ringer over the years constantly getting it wet dropping it off the back of the golf cart listening to music with the volume at max constantly this thing is tank have yet to hear portable bluetooth speaker that can come close to matching the volume output or the sound quality as the jbl ,5
decent headphones my sons both have ordered pair and while they generally work pretty well they have had few hangups with them while playing games sometimes they have to be plugged and unplugged couple times before the sound works and sometimes it just doesn seem to want to work at all and yes the volume is up but overall they work about of the time and they were pretty cheap so ,1
for some reason thought this took batteries but it doesnt it has an on board battery that takes usb to charge no big deal have note and keep charger at my desk got it because its waterproof and work in bar accidents happen haven used that feature yet but ll update if do battery life is good lights look cool but you can turn them off if you want buy again ,5
great little speaker for outside we take this speaker with us to the beach and camping the sound is decent and love how rugged it is is plus don have to worry about leaving it out in the rain know that there are speakers out there with better sound but the price of them is also lot higher as for camper and beach life this will do just fine for me ,5
i bought the keyboard for my boyfriend it awesome great to use in the dark although when the lights are pulsating the keyboard does make ringing sound other than that it was really easy for him to adjust from his old keyboard to this one and we ve charged it once for like minutes and it been working for days of use so the battery life is great definitely nice product,5
i got this mouse for my daughter and she was beyond excited when we finally received it well day it wouldn charge so gave it break and decided to try charging it on my mac she had originally tried her school chrome book few seconds of it being plugged in it started smoking it smelled like burning plastic so quickly just unplugged and didn bother doing anything else with the mouse ,5

i had been using friend charge and liked it so was looking at the charge and when bought mine the charge is little bit bigger and has better louder sound was very happy with my purchase like that it has aux port and bluetooth capabilities use both features teach zumba class and don have to charge it too often it plenty loud and doesn need to be plugged in for class ,1
i had intended on buying megaboom but got to test out this speaker along with boom and megaboom and the fullness of sound in particular the quality of the bass on this thing blew those two out of the water the non universal charge cord is little annoying but oh well don expect to get sub bass out of this thing it would have to be about inches taller for that ,5
i just received this is the last week or so and it is exactly what expected turned it on it lights up keys are responsive and it even goes to sleep which really like customer service reached out with generic email hope you got it if not let us know leave review all that they also gave information about making the lights brighter and dimmer and the different settings very nice ,1
i ordered this mouse really liked it it was slim fit nicely in my hand and loved how the lights changed colors after few months there was problem with it when the company found out they gladly refunded me my purchase price with no questions asked great customer service would order it again after dealing with them if hadn already bought another mouse because had work to finish give them stars,1

i purchased this mouse to replace the corded mouse in my office have used it for little over week now and am completely satisfied with the way it works and how my hand feels ergonomically speaking it is so much better than the standard chunkier mouses ve used most of my professional career my hand is in resting position while using it and remains free from stress and strain love it ,1
i really like this mouse it small and slim so it doesn make my wrist sit at weird angle it also has good battery life think ve only charged it like once since bought it several months ago it pretty responsive and light and overall it great quality for the money it does feel little cheap and fragile because of how light it is but that doesn bother me at all ,1
i use this keyboard with my gaming laptop only when not using my gaming desktop the keyboard is quite nice and responsive but the battery dies very fast use it maybe mins day and it dies in week would much rather have less backlighting and aa batteries can swap out hate when it dies in the middle of game and then have to plug it in and wait while it charges ,1
i ve had this wireless keyboard for almost month this is my first one because my brother was the one that recommended this to me had get used to the backlit lights not being on all the time but overall this is an excellent wireless keyboard and have not had an issue with it it came undamaged and it arrived quick and the customer service at klim has excellent customer service ,5
its just literally not working at all charged it for three hours and connected the usb to the adapter and plugged it in to my macbook and it just does not work have turned it on and off put the usb back in the mouse and tried again and again and it just will not work instructions were absolutely useless since it just said to turn the mouse on and off ,5

my younger don first bought this mouse for his mac mini since then we fell in love with it and my wife bought this for her work laptopit nice to get the customization of color and also very ergonomic in use and effective in performancewe use this mouse in all kinds of setting desk lap bed and even in cars never had issuesawesome and looking forward to rd one to buy ,5

nice gaming headset for cheap mic works great sound is great and the options to use for xbox ps or computer is pretty sweet my only gripe is the noise cancelling isn anywhere near bose beats or jbl and if you have pumpkin head like myself it houses big brain for gaming duh this headset can be little uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time overall stars and buy again,5
right out the box noticed the very plastic cheap feel the rbg lights are bright but honestly bought it for cheap mouse after using it for while the wrist did start hurting little the worse part is after it died for the first time did full charge and it has not worked since sure can go through the warranty but ll just take the loss you get what you paid for ,1
so there is no way to turn off the sleep mode the point of lit keyboard was to see the keys after sixty seconds the light turns off and have to hit random key to get the light on that makes the entire purchase waste asked for lit keyboard because needed keyboard that would be lit this is not lit for more than minute at time it an unlit lit keyboard ,1
the headphones themselves are okay but the microphone is horrible it not flexible or adjustable in any way so you can actually get close enough to it to sound better than muffled to anyone else in voice chat it sounds like you re speaking through wad of cotton or from another room have no idea how this has gotten so many five star reviews when the microphone is so so bad ,1
the lettering on the kb is so faint you can see them unless the backlit is on problem is you can turn auto dim off which means you have to hit key to wake it up if you can have it backlit when you reach for it when gaming it utterly useless in dark room does it work for the price yes does it work for gaming nope not at all ,5
there are two things like about this wireless mouse it rechargeable it took me while to get used to plugging it into my laptop when not using it but it easy through the usb cable they provide and the charge lasts and while there is an on off button it not so necessary as it goes into sleep mode when close my laptop all told am very satisfied with this mouse ,5
these are fantastic the sound quality is amazing better than our multi thousand dollar home system of decades old high end speakers for those few who complain that the speaker is mono say of course how much stereo separation would you expect out of an inch system we re getting two more one for stereo separation in the great room the other to bring great sound to the master bath area ,5
this is over year old however used intermittently and recently continuously disconnects from multiple sources making it worthless to have to keep re setting every minutes and sometimes seconds our last jbl was amazing and had amazing sound for only years when power source broke we replaced power source and still working but should not have quit after years of occassional use great product too short of life span for products ,1
used these headphones while playing on the ps did stream to test out how sound to other it was basically at whisper even when was raising my voice same problem when tested the mic using my phone the sound output is also low raised my ps headphone volume and it wasn any louder then the headphones was using before at lower volume the wheel didn help in either of these situations ,1
when first received the mouse it worked well and enjoyed the multi colors however after month it constantly needed to be charged by three months it no longer cycled the different colors but was only red now at the month mark it no longer tracks move the mouse but my cursor doesn move on the screen ve never had mouse go bad this quickly will not be purchasing this mouse again ,5
would not recommend at all it has not been holding charge for us at all the only way we get it to play is if we charge it fully and then leave it plugged in while it on it also cuts out very frequently and we have my phone sometimes sitting right next to the speaker the sounds quality when it works is good but that only maybe of the time ,5
yeah know it relatively cheap but didn expect it to be that feeble the sound and recording quality is pretty bad might as well just talk through laptop open mic even with software noise suppression the listening quality is pretty awful worthless for music listening the mic itself is has poor response and acquisition then there the usb which is only used to light the headset leds up really just shabby ,5
 the headphones don fit adult ears the headphones aren very loud at all turned them all the way up just to actually hear footsteps in my game the lights don work unless your in pc don care too much about that the mic sounds terrible my friends clowned me for having such god awful mic this would be the last gaming headset would buy don waste your money on this ,5
bought for my husband as far as he has told me and can tell he like them lot he uses them for xbox gaming and we bought them in pinch because our youngest broke his and he has like them so far noise canceling works pretty well if you ask me have to either go up to him and tap him or yell super loud for him to hear me ,5
bought this awhile ago to start setting up my home office didn need it right away so set the box aside pulled it out this weekend to discover that the keys don work correctly multiple keys are stuck together typing or displays tg for example keyboard is essentially useless but because didn examine it right away my return window has expired and stuck with junk that doesn work lesson learned ,5
developers really did number with this device this mouse speaks for itself it is actually just what the marketing team indicated awesome am customizable type of consumer thus enjoy my share of intriguing components that of which deviates from the mundane norm this led mouse wowed me with the illuminating colorful lighting and the smoothness upon usage very well crafted and look forward to purchasing other colors as time progress ,1

great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic perfect for the bag that has just enough space when you re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly it sleep mode feature is nice adage increasing battery life and usability as far as gaming goes would recommend only lite casual games only not for gaming on the heavy side overall would buy again,5

i assumed this speaker had bump and more than speaker inside well was wrong big time it speaker on the right and it only gets loud with volume cranked all the way up had aomias speaker that bumped louder and was for only this speaker is overpriced for what it offers only goo thing is the charge port is usb which doesn break as easy as the standard android port ,5
i bought this back in january to use it for work initially worked perfect after about two weeks the speaker was not audible tried all necessay adjustments volume on both my devices computer and phone but unsuccessfull no one could hear me talk cant return because its past return date however as fas as sound listening is concerned it is good may be got substandard product as see good reviews,1
i bought this for gaming with friends on ps and for the first few days it worked fine but after that the sound quality just got really bad and it started noticing some of the flaws which just proved to me how cheaply made they were if you don mind that they ll be alright for the price but for me and many others it ll hardly be worth it ,5
i bought this last year not wanting to pay for premium mouse and after seeing so many comments turns out it mistake the mouse stops working after few months when work from home the pointer just doesn react at all only the scroll works if it functional mouse it actually quite well made and like the design overall my kid loves the color sadly have to put on this review ,1

i got the product and tried to use it plugged it into the usb slot of my ps the light went on and turned the mute off and volume up the headset does not work at all can hear people talking from my television but not in the headset or the headset is not being picked up by the game or working strongly do not recommend as it doesn work ,5
i got this wireless mouse for my daughter because she was getting tired of using the old wired mouse for playing games on the pc so far her experience with it has been great the size was perfect for her average teen hand and she lefty the main avantage was the mouse was rechargable so we don have to worry about replacing the battery every so offten plus for me ,1

i had the mouse charging all weekend when returned to work monday morning smelled something hot but no one else smelled anything went to unplug my mouse and my cord was so hot couldn even touch it the entire cord melted and the wires had burned through the rubber coating very easily could have caught my computer on fire do not buy this mouse unless you have great fire insurance ,5

i like that the mouse is slim also like the lights and how smooth it is the sleep mode works fine use the mouse for work am happy with the rechargeable functionality and find don need to recharge daily so far have recharged every few days and don know how long the change will last but at least days for daily work use it is good value in my opinion ,1

i love the comfort of the headset at first was little uncomfortable due to the fact never had headsets this large before but the comfort and the quality of the set adjust my way of thinking about the sets brought them for gaming and video calls the quality is great from the voice end to the listening side the mute is not difficult and easy to plug in and use ,5
i ve been on the hunt for gaming headset for while now and stumbled across these what really caught my eye first was the price of these can beat that and secondly the led effect sold me tried these out and think they have great noise cancellation and love that you can adjust the volume of it and it also comes with multiple cords to connect with many different devices ,5
i ve had this speaker for years and the battery life is unreal left this speaker on the lowest battery possible at friends house in his shed and then he went to college and couldn get the speaker for literally year and half after sitting in the freezing cold for nearly two years on the lowest battery left it still connected and played great quality for over an hour speaker ,5
i was looking to buy portable mouse for travel and was going to buy regular battery one but saw this pop up as an option really like the mint green color it affordable easy to use connects fast and very low profile the clicker is quiet too scroller works great as well charged it up connected via usb to my dock station and it was ready to go love it ,5

loved the product look and that it was rechargeable however the battery didn hold the charge long enough for the device to properly connect via bluetooth so you had to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose of wireless mouse also the shape for the mouse provided little comfort as it caused my palm to cramp after two days of use returning item and going back to logitech brand ,5

my husband is gamer and was in need of new keyboard he chose this one because it had everything he wanted and needed especially the wireless feature as he likes to lay back and not worry about dealing with cords pretty sure he dropped it on his desk few times and it is still going the colors are vibrant types well and looks very nice highly recommend this great value ,5
ok so love my new keyboard however there is one thing that is going to drive me crazy aside from by phone watch am terrible about having to recharge things am using this keyboard for work and it died on me twice it definitely my bad but still never had to worry about recharging keyboard before so if you are like me you may want to reconsider otherwise no complaints ,1
ordered shortly after christmas and once arrived had issues connecting after realizing my only route to get it to work was to constantly turn the mouse on and off after less than week and one charge it will no longer do anything no lights no power no connection and won charge with the included cord or any other spend the money on different brand this was like ordering from wish ,5

originally liked the idea of not having to use batteries tried using this mouse for about week when finished using it forgot to plug it in so the next time tried to use it the power was zapped that pretty much defeats the purpose of having cordless mouse with no power had to use it when plugged into my laptop sent it back and got mouse that requires on battery ,1

sound quality is decent for the price point in the segment one complaint is the lowest volume setting is too loud for an office setting which was the main purpose of my purchase the drivers are ok for the size but don expect to hear all the lows from your music it better than most but for the money rather have spent little more and gotten larger more versatile speaker ,5
stopped working very disappointed was enjoying using the mouse working from home and only used for that purpose charged every days very disappointed the lifespan was short review update on product very happy with the customer service they reached out and provided refund customer service goes long way when you receive services or products having great customer service make you more confident in the company due to nothing is perfect ,5
the good easy plug and play connection keys are lit up real good and easy to see in the dark keys have nice feel to them and are relatively quiet so far battery charge lasts the whole day of pretty solid gaming the bad user manual is kinda so so backlighting turns off kinda quickly and sure that can be adjusted but again the user manual is kinda so so ,5
the keyboard is light as feather so you have to be very careful with it the rgb lights do not blink it his modes high med and off the things like about it is its wireless and can get at last days do not type much so this can be why lol it will go to sleep in sec was told its sec know it will good to sleep fast,1
the user was not expecting rechargeable keyboard and has been pleasantly surprised by this one the bells and whistles haven been main draw past the first day or two fiddling with the colors performance wise this keyboard has been standing up well to normal business use and the recharge at night is not onerous it just one last thing to do before heading out for the day no big deal ,5
these are great very heavy duty very comfortable the volume is wonderful no static couldn be any more happy with my purchase love how they come with different attachments so they will fit any device that you use have spent on pair and these work the same if not better will recommend these to everyone know and we will never purchase headphones through anyone else ever again we are lifetimers ,5
these headsets have great sound which was surprised the transmit volume is little low but you can still be heard and for me it doesn fit well but my daughter said they do her after hearing the sound from these am probably going to order me new pair cause mine apparently are horrible but won these cause they just don fit me well for kid would recommend them in heartbeat ,5
this came with an adaptor to fit the apple laptop but is not made specifically for apple products the charge does not last long and needs special adaptor prefer battery operated mouse as maintaining so many different chargers on my desk is cumbersome the three settings for on off are also less than ideal in summary while this mouse is aesthetically pretty it is not functional with the apple products ,5

this keyboard is good inexpensive wireless keyboard the colors are nice and bright with button for adjusting the brightness you can also turn the rgb off all together the battery life is very good usually get around days of battery life without ever turning it off and heavy use it not mechanical keyboard so if you re purist would stay away from it but for normal life use it great ,5
used these for gaming on my pc everyone was playing with told me there was consistent background static every time cued my mic tried several different ways to correct the static from setting up the headset on the pc and updating drivers and the issue persisted the overall features of the headset were good but the static issue won work for me returned these and will be purchasing different brand ,5
when first received this charged it as recommended and it lit up so seemed to work as expected after charged put the toggle in my usb port and nothing happened it didn download anything it didn pair with my laptop let it sit then tried again nothing it won charge it won light up nothing never even used it and it stopped working very disappointed and total waste of money ,1

battery won charge guess you get what you pay for save the or whatever this cost is and invest in something better wow don trust these other reviews guys if you write bad review aka the truth they will ask you to delete it if the product doesn work obviously people are going to say something save your money people and buy from someone else that is better quality ,5
dad bit deaf and had bose stuff in the past he asked me to order him bose version of this after some research bought this instead jbl charge dad loves it it works great and plays loud sound quality is better than would have expected from small speaker but it mono speaker so not exactly highfi and it in no way reference monitor for what it is it great ,5
for the price you re getting something better than most other expensive headsets do want to say that the people who can get the mic to work need to stop using the splitter that thing is for older tower pc that use pair of ports one for the output and one for the input can use these on my laptop pc and use the mic fine without the splitter ,5
i bought this for my daughter and she loves it the colors are great which is what she loves most it also very lightweight simple to use and reasonably priced like that you can charge it instead of having to change batteries the most important thing for me is durability she is child and is still kind of rough with her electronics but so far it is holding up ,1

it is good speaker the sound quality is great no complains about it it feels really good built and the bass is great but the volume it is not as good as thought would be not bad at all because of the speaker size the batery time claims to be hours of playtime but havent try for that long yet but in general terms it is good speaker,5
it nothing fancy so don expect something over the top its basic keyboard with an led under lay the keys are not mechanical so you will press little harder customer support was great my keyboard stopped charging and reached out for help they offered free shipping label and to fix it since was under warranty instead they sent me new one was happy about that good experience overall,5
like other reviews stated this mouse is super nice smooth and looks neat but lasted just over the day return window put it on charge for the th time since had received it and the blue light comes on indicating it is charging and goes off some time later indicating it is complete when you switch it on the red light flashes and then goes off highly disappointing ,5

ordered this for my th grader she has laptop provided by her school and she received laptop from her grandparents as gift easy to switch between laptops with this mouse so she can watch youtube and play games on her personal laptop and scroll and jump between apps easily on the school laptop of course its not as solid as the apple version so thats why not stars,5
overall love this mouse the size weight clicking is all fabulous however ve had two of these now and the middle scroller has randomly fallen in without rough use it wasn dropped literally was not even touching it the second time and heard it fall if you need to use the middle scroller lot do not recommend purchase if you don use that feature then it great mouse ,1

so far so good this speaker gets loud without distortion love it and the color so much also like that it can charge my phone it convenient because my area is often plagued by wind storms and power outages sure ll be using it for that soon enough it was super easy to connect haven had any issues with the bluetooth connectivity the battery life is very good ,5
the charge will connect with boombox other charge charge will not connect to anything so don bother trying bought new renewed neither connected the connect button acting like the blue tooth button jbl dropped ball on it fixed it on charge ue booms are best for connecting their price sound quality is better than jbl but jbl has better base response when you want to play speaker loud ,5
this is my first wireless keyboard in life and love it the standby time is outstanding the battery life is superb love how the keyboard lights up with different colors as well have not experienced any lag or disconnection of the keyboard from my pc while using it while in idle if key is pressed it immediately connects without problem great product definitely would recommend it to others ,5
this is the rd set ve had to purchase for my son in the last year we kept buying the cheap headsets and they would all last couple months before the mic would quit working or the audio quality became really bad finally broke down and bought him nicer more expensive set and so far they are amazing at the quality and tech that is in those things ,1
update the company contacted me and sent me new headphone with mic it arrived few days ago and it works they mentioned they are sourcing their mic parts from new supplier hopefully their quality will improve my son used this for few hours each week for months then the microphone quit working the product has pathetic useful life put your dollars towards another headset this one is worthless ,5
using this for gaming and music and stuff lights work and the mic remote works quality is ok quality could be better but its cheap you know how it is some things are good other things are cheap some things are both good and cheap but then they re broken so you know how it is life can be that way for many folks out here in america ,5
y all now know that haven had this keyboard long at all weeks but it is game changer the sound of the keys isn too loud but it not so soft that you feel unproductive love the way that the keys actually feel when am typing the color of the keyboard is great too would purchase this keyboard at full price all over again if had to primeday,5
cheap plastic feel right out the box the audio would cut out just from moving the wire even the most basic movement caused it to short out horrible sound quality when it did work even at the highest level it was barely audible got the headset because of the high ratings but looking at the lower scores it would seem that my issue isn an isolated occurrence ,5
i admit the placement of the enter key is little weird but otherwise it great keyboard don use it for gaming it just my wireless keyboard use for remote work at home have long nails and consequently my typing can be really noisy so love how quiet the keys are on this keyboard after month battery life is really good so far and the colors are pretty ,1
i bought this for my surface go and it didn work properly and instead of returning it thought would take it to work finally did so today shame on me for not doing it earlier because it still isn working and now it too late to return it it feels great and the lights are fun just make sure you re happy before the return window closes ,5

i really like this keyboard and so far it lives up to all of my expectations didn but it for gaming but rather to replace work keyboard that hated to type on enjoy the lighted colors the numeric keypad and the easy set up with little dongle to plug in and you re ready to go also believe that customer service moving forward will be very good ,1

i was getting sick of my clickity clackity keyboard so went with this don game lot on it but haven noticed any input delay while playing fps my only gripe is the sleep mode is annoying because you can see the keyboard at all when it turns off sure you can change it up just haven bothered looking into it yet lightweight and sleek keeper for sure ,5
jbl is beautifully designed sounds just perfect the only problem is if you give it to your daughter for her eighteenth birthday days later she may irresponsibley drive around town with it in her car and leave it at her friend house for weeks then one of her friends will likely steal it because it is such fantastic little speaker just take that into consideration before purchasing ,5
just so you know loved the simple amazon wireless mouse but our cats kept knocking it off the table and the battery cover would come off over and over stupid cats but now with this mouse the battery is rechargeable the cats can tear it apart and it has cool lights on it the function is good the price was low everything is solid so recommend it ,1

like others have reported the mouse curser jumps around and blinks after short min period of use making it difficult to control and sometimes nonresponsive you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision charged it over the weekend thinking the battery was not fully charged but the same results this morning have requested refund and will be purchasing something that works ,5

overall the speaker is great it is quite bit hefty but that is to be expected with all the rubber keeping it waterproof as well as the rest of the hardware inside the battery life is pretty spot on with about hour of constant usage and the sound is clear and loud very much worth the purchase and if you catch it on sale even more so ,5
positives excellent speaker for portability and battery life great for worry free music at the beach or around pool and they are loud great looking speakers that are small and very portable negatives sound lacks quality if you just want loud good sound this speaker will make happy if you re looking for quality you will need to step it up to bigger jbl or different product ,5
so do like that the mouse fits well in my hand is very responsive and works very well for everyday use like that the mouse click is very quiet have had no problems with the mouse so far would recommend this mouse as it works very well and you can also adjust the sensitivity or how fast it tracks by adjusting the dpi nice feature to have ,5
so its bit to much base for the how much sound even with some movies think would he more like it but im cheap so idk its seems to be bit heavy on the positives decent battery good base durable havnt put it in water afraid too do to the cover being put back on looks to not go back on the way would like it to,1
the headphones are used by my son mainly for his classes they are very comfortable to spend lot of time listening to them without being distracted by external noises he also uses it for games he does not need to be connected to his pc he can listen to his classes away from home or even camping connected to his smartphone he is very happy with these ,5
the major flaw with the mouse for me is that the battery life is almost nonexistent it lasts only about hours for me guessing the one got may be defective because need to have this plugged in all the time to make it usable but can work that way not factoring in the battery everything else is great in comparison to other mice in this price range ,1

the mouse worked adequately when it arrived after couple weeks it started going through periods where the sensor was unresponsive one minute and then worked fine the next at this point its mostly unusuable it has an annoying habit of losing connection and suddenly staring straight up while gaming makes fast paced competitive games nearly impossible waste your money on some other brand piece of junk mouse ,5
these noise canceling headphones do not have hardware and software that is actually known as noise canceling in them it merely refers to the fact that the headphones go over your ears and do minimal job of blocking outside noise these headphones do play noise and it does have microphone but if you re looking for something that has actual noise canceling tech in it look elsewhere ,5
this headset is extremely good headset has comfort in the ear pieces it glows and that just makes them cooler lol they have great sound come with great microphone literally have no complaints about the headset ended up returning them because needed something smaller and more dainty for my work from home job being that am required to wear headset each working day for plus hours day ,5
this is not good product we all know the number of good reviews online for this item are inflated by bots was feeling cheap and ordered this headset as replacement and it was even worse than expected the fit is terrible the materials are hilariously cheap and the mic was broken out of the box the joke is on me for ordering these be smarter than am ,5
this mouse is so sensitive if the surface is not absolutely debris free or flat signal signal won be sent from the wireless mouse to the computer screen ve had it for several weeks and have tried it with several mouse pads surfaces paper under the mouse it just not good fit like the changing light color it very pretty but for me not great wireless mouse ,5

this mouse is wonderful to use for precise things such as line drawing and making flow charts it is super comfortable to use unfortunately bought this at the beginning of the year and now it will not charge so basically now have corded mouse which is what needed to avoid so until find highly rated cordless or battery operated one will be tied to the computer literally ,5

this was really good mouse quiet clicks very lightweight and it moved smoothly over my mouse pad it fell opened up bit was able to put it clip it back in but after the third fall the ball stopped working but for the price it def worth it long battery life think charged like middle of every other week and used it from weekdays for about hours ,5

we first purchased this in december for my then year old he absolutely loved it after almost years of steady regular usage it was still holding up just fine then we got puppy who decided she liked the cords better for herself than the child when asked what kind of replacement he wanted he said the exact same one have had and so we purchased second one ,5
worked great for month mouse connects via usb receiver ve only disconnected the receiver few times when not using the mouse however after disconnecting few times can reconnect the receiver without it being loose the instant my mouse connects it will disconnect because the usb is too loose now after month edit customer service reps have reached out to me offering me money to delete my review ,5

 at this point call this false advertising bought this to use on discord unless you have room for feet of cable and want to have that garbled my mike will never work sound quality don bother buying this piece of junk not to mention there are just so many things to plug in it cheaply made and get something better at dollar general waste of time ,1
at first just loved the mouse and it was so pretty when turn on the lights but when it was time to recharge and it just never recharged and tried and tried for well over day its dead and only two weeks old so disappointed so will be purchasing another wireless mouse from another company instead simply not worth my time to fuss with returning etc ,5

at first thought it wasn going to be as good because of the price too cheap and honestly surprised the audio is pretty good better than what expected the cancelation noise is awesome can almost hear myself you can unmute and mute also lower and raise the volume which think it awesome overall better than excepted and the price is very good for what you get ,5
bought this to replace my old jbl flip was hoping that going little bigger would bring some better low end but disappointed nice looking speaker connects easily but was looking for better sound this seems to really push lot of mid range went with bugani for half the price it bigger than the charge but the sound was way better in my side by side comparison ,5
don expect the bluetooth to work it didn work for my device but it works as mouse tried it gaming not the best recommend spending the extra cash for good gaming mouse but if you need or want mouse for clicking and dragging go ahead but the lights don turn off and again the bluetooth didn work for me it might work for you who knows ,5
first you can either have the headset glowing or you can actually use the mic pick one you cant have both secondly maybe its just mine but my headset is completly lopsoded crocked however you want me to say it third due to it being uneven sound quality isnt great no noise cancelation and its not as loud as would like it last its uncomfortable period,5
great keyboard easy to use in the dark but wish it has screen light option to turn down or up the screen brightness but it just has the brightness of the keyboard the battery last like days no indicator to tell you it dying it just shuts off but it does tell you its charging yay pgot to get used to the ergonomic like all things ,5
i bought mouse for my daughter after she took my mouse while on vacation she loves it it has location to place the usb connector while not plugged in it has low profile which looks good with any computer plus it has usb to usb connect along with usb charging cable it also has solid color mode and changes colors mode good price for wireless mouse ,5
i got this mouse for my year daughter for christmas she loves how it fits her hands and how is changes colors what she likes the most is how quiet it is when clicking the button the family wireless mouse is bit loud when clicked she will be using it for school and her chromebook not really gaming mouse and there is only buttons and wheel ,5
i have been using this keyboard for almost and half months and at first issues with finding the on off switch for turning on wireless and had to have both plugged into my computer for wireless and charging after found the switch on the back it made everything easier and more convenient would recommend this to anyone looking for good wireless keyboard with long battery life ,5
i have not had this mouse for little over days love the feel of the mouse and how sleek it is however no matter how much charge the mouse it stops responding after about minutes of use have found myself removing the dongle from my laptop several times day just to make the mouse respond bought the mouse to improve my work functionality to no avail ,1

i like the feel of this keyboard the back lighting works well it solid keyboard the only reason didn give it stars is the back slash key is next to the enter key all my other keyboard have it above the enter key frequently hit the backslash when intending to press enter ll get use to it and would probably them give this stars after do ,1
i love jbl speakers my wife has had jbl clip for the past years and got this as birthday present to replace it and let me tell you the audio quality is phenomenal use it in the kitchen while cook and she uses it when choreographing dances it is great speaker and well priced jbl speaker will last long time too we still have the clip ,5
i never write reviews as matter of fact this is the first have ever written but due to the danger factor felt compelled to my son plugged in his mouse this morning and walked away and within minute my husband smelled something burning and fortunately was able to get to it before the flames yes flames reached the drapes because the charging cable caught on fire ,5

i own of these now as purchased the second specifically because jbl advertises that you can link up to something like of these together to all play the same music wanted that for my backyard while this speaker sounds great on its own found the process of connecting it my original jbl speaker to be very challenging and it keeps cutting in and out very choppy ,5
i think this mouse is great love the led colors changing it goes to sleep after little while to save battery life it very simple to charge if it ever needs it my only thing about it and it not even negative about the device is that my hands are very big so this seems little tinier than like still though got no complaints about it ,1

i use this with my laptop at school and it works great haven had to charge it yet but you can still use it while charging it thin and fits neatly into my bag left it on accidentally for couple of days and it had turned off and the battery was still good the lights are fun and can be turned off so long dead batteries ,1
i ve gone through or of these in less than year they are not durable in my teenagers hands sure they are not the most gentle with them either buy them because they are cheap and we just need to get through the school year have switched brands recently to see if it them or this brand that just breaks it always the scrollers that break ,1

i very comfortable ergonomically feel internal rechargeable batteries and instant connection while setting up for the first time took less than seconds from taking it out of the box to working the button press is also really smooth and doesn feel like hard click the roller knob at the top is fairly smooth and the transitional led lighting looks really good very happy with this purchase,1

i was surprised at the quality of the headset the sound coming from the as well as the microphone are good quality wouldn say they are noise cancelling as could still hear people talking that are sitting next to me but these were not purchased for noise cancelling the sound is very good and they are comfortable didn think they were that heavy for their size ,5
i was tired of the wire noises and the knots they created it was always mess plus it stopped working hence was looking for mouse this mouse is amazing it is light easy to connect the led works good doesn make sound and the customer service is good if you are looking for mouse with low budget this is definitely the one you are looking for ,1

it nice laptop but won say it for hardcore gamers the backlight stays rainbow colored and will turn on after few seconds of non use which makes it difficult to use it in the dark have to hit the spacebar just to turn the lights back on and that annoying the wireless feature is nice and ve had no real issues other than the light problem ,5
literally only had the mouse for three days and used it on the first day and now it has stopped working it doesn charge plug it up and it may charge for minutes then it just stops charging then when go to turn it on it just turns on and instantly turns off this mouse is literally piece of crap will be getting my money back ,5

love the over all sixe and make of the unit the mic has no problem and one you set the volume to hear others on the phone or computer you are good to go th long chord is bit much for close phone use so the velcro tab was hepful till set tie rap as workout or in my wheel chair dose not need trip hazards ,1
ok product for price point wish battery lasted longer the keys are little awkward have to press harder than normal keyboard but for the price happy love it in the dark wish you could change the rainbow effect to solid color but happy overall use it for work so cannot give full review for gaming but did like the fact no software needed to be installed ,1
once got this product read the manual and did everything step by step including charging the mouse and it will not work after minutes of messing with it the led lights started flashing and got it to work for little while then it stopped again this product is not good and needed it for school but would hate to take an exam and have these issues ,5
shipping was fast and loved the leds but today after week it stopped working figured it needed charge it now been connected to my laptop for over three hours and the blue light has gone off which is supposed to mean is all charged and ready to go but when disconnect it nothing dead guess the low price was giveaway should have paid more attention to ,5

the audio quality and fit are pretty nice however key feature needed was mic built into the headset the gain on the mic is maybe making it completely inaudible loud blowing into the mic brings it up to an audible level on playback but far from normal interaction when conversing will continue to use my very old logitech mic which is far superior in audio capture ,1
the ergonomics are good but it has fatal flaw that makes it unusable when you first turn it on it works fine but after minutes or so it becomes very twitchy or jerky and completely unusable tried it on both macs and pcs same problem with both systems it too cheap to bother sending back but want to warn others not to make the same mistake ,5

the fact that it has quiet mechanism no sound whatsoever during clicking was great but even though only used it for my desktop computer at work days week it is not working right now did not carry it around or used it for more than hour during each day basically because use my laptop most of time months is pretty premature time frame to not function ,1

the headphones arrived very quickly as someone who has been using them for quite few months now they are very durable have unfortunately dropped them on the mic good few times but to all surprise they have held up sound quality is good and so is the mic they do get smudged quite easily though but you get what you pay for overall solid from me ,5
the headset is very high quality and the price is actually cheap so you will get an amazing headset for few bucks this headset is light weight and has very good quality sound for the price and is very comfortable microphone works good as well lights on the sides of the headset make it look nice this product is very good very happy with the purchase ,5
the mic is really great and has good sound quality was amazed that it was as good as it is for the price you pay for it but the only downside to it is the mic doesn have the clearest of sound and you kinda sound like you re in box but would recommend it to anyone who looking for cheap mic with great sound quality ,1
the mouse is super sleek and comfortable for people who like their hands more flat super pretty when all lit up and works perfectly but you better not drop it or drop anything you re carrying it in because it instantly will stop working every minutes you use it there after should have expected this from such cheap mouse but after one minor drop is ridiculous ,5

there really isn anything to dislike about this mouse the setup process is virtually non existent you just plug in the usb and you re good to go have been using it for more than week and haven had to charge it yet the light display is neat added bonus great for dark room adventures long story short it does what expected but better great buy ,1

this gaming headset does not light up when you play this only lights up when plugged in to the usb for charging only initially bought it because thought the led would show when gaming which is the main purpose but was wrong plus the cables are way to short to have it plugged in and the surround system is bad wouldn recommend buying this cheap mic ,5
this is based on this exact unit was going to return it but was to busy in the time frame have the same unit purchased from someone else and the sound quality is better and the way it runs is better this unit cuts out often out of nowhere with full charge and the sound quality is worse than the other charge green that we own,5
this is nice sleek little mouse very pleased with the size and the connection range was looking for one that wasn too clunky but still looked decent this definitely fits the bill all the awesome colors is just plus for my own personal amusement also if you don want the lights all the time there is setting for that too good little mouse for the price ,1

this mouse is extremely lightweight and easy to use love the lights that constantly change while you re using it the best part for me is the fact that it rechargeable just plug it into any usb plug it into my laptop at the end of the day battery usually lasts me few full days of work sleep mode is great and helps prolong battery life ,1

totally deceptive they raised the price what joke nothing makes me more mad than when company puts american flags all over their listing and the label on the box says made in china why because this is deceptive marketing even if the box didnt say this how do know because the letter key didnt work and the power switch was stuck immediate return do not buy ,5
update received my free headset for leaving comment and review and its awesome would definitely recommend doing so if you want free headset it looks good and easy to use no complications and comes with adapter for pc really like them so far only down fall is when using for playstation or any aux plug the headset does not light up only lights when using usb ,5
was happy at first to see the design of the product but came to realize if type to quickly the keyboard my miss the key letter you put in it kept happening then got my wireless work one and realize don miss beat the klim keyboard have seems to not be able to read at fat pace when typing that comes to me as big issue ,5
we bought speakers to see which one we loved more this was the note expensive one and after we tried then both it wasn even close the quality of this speaker was awful compared to an off brand and it was half the cost wouldn spend this type of money on it just for the name there are better ones that are way better and cheaper ,5
when got this immediately ran into problems with the mic my friends couldn hear me and could barely hear them it never picked up my voice no matter how loudly spoke they would hear every other word but never the complete sentence tried to work with it for weeks but ended up using my webcam mic for while because it sounded better and could be heard ,5
works great adjustable lighting stays charged for long time no chord in the way smooth keys light weight only small complaints when it is in sleep mode whatever key you hit to wake it actually works therefore you have possibly typed wrong key when using password to open something also you can pick one solid color again nothing major would buy another one or recommend it ,5
 cannot type in frequently for no reason when it not working it connected with pc for sure because tab alt was working but others like space enter delete and all have no reactions using my phone to write this review because can type in amazon com in my browser if it only happened time that fine the problem is it happened several times so frustrated ,1
about weeks after return window closed quit working completely should have returned sooner as the charge lasts only about one full work day spent lot of time fooling around with mouse tool that should be something you don have to think about or make plans to be available for use going back to tried and true battery wireless which lasts about year and no hassle ,1

battery life was great worked great for while but it will not charge first time went to charge it plug it into my laptop and power brick it lights up for seconds then shuts off now it won turn on at all sadly would love to give this product more stars but now this is useless and can even use it while it plugged in ,1

cordless mouse is okay out of the box after few months of use it starting to wear out now have to start double clicking to make sure it responds to the icons click on colors are still great it great not having to change batteries it pretty much quite as far as clicking but as noted above it will still wear out sooner than expected ,5

decent enough sound quality but already have quality headphones for audio the product is borderline unusable because whenever use push to talk feature it just plays whatever sounds it making back into the mic as input my friends cannot hear me all they can hear is game sound whatever song have on laughably terrible feature it almost be better if it just didn input anything ,1
excellent feel but no warning when battery about to die which negates it for competitive gaming enter key also has horrible design and placement for work the dongle does not work if using kvm switch or if direct line of sight is not allowed if you can snag used one for less than new price it may be worth it but would not buy again ,5
for the price these are amazing and the best headphones for the price if you re casually gaming and or have neighbors that don like hearing noises this is the headset for you if you re competing online and need to communicate clearly with your teammates do not recommend this headset for you because the audio is not crystal clear from the built in microphone ,5
i am so happy with this purchase can believe what great sounding portable speaker this is love this speaker so much that even just got case to protect it not that it needs but it built like tank and the other great thing is that it can even charge your phone if you need to but man awesome sound think it good price for it ,1
i bought one for my laptop and days after got it the wheel stopped working and could hear something loose inside it returned it for replacement the new one seems to be working fine although sometimes the cursor glides smoothly across the screen and other times it jumps around lot maybe this is just something wireless mice do don know ve never had one before ,5

i bought these for work they allow me to blockout most of the conversations in the room and allow me to focus on my own thoughts sound quality is good listen to music audiobooks and participate in video conferences they are not too heavy am able to wear them all day with my mask and eyeglasses they do not apply extra pressure to me ears ,1
i bought this because of the lights and it looked cool but it does not have battery it needs to be plugged in to charge unless you babysit it by always turning it off when you are done using it the charge dies after days and then you have dead mouse or one that is now wired as it charges too high maintenance for mouse ,5

i bought this headset as the third replacement for my year old who tends to be tough on electronics he loves the fact that it lights up and it drowns out noise he says that it comfortable and sounds great he has only had it short time but it is still holding up pretty well we will see how great the durability is in time ,5

i expected the earmuffs to actually fit over my ears but these are too small and just sit on top of my ear pressing then down which with long gaming sessions causes fair amount of pain an discomfort edit today may the seller bengoo contacted me directly and offered me as an incentive to remove my negative review which is violation of amazons sellers policies ,1
i got this for my laptop and it does not work very well it skips or just does not move at all gave it to my grandson thinking that since it says it for gaming that maybe it would work better for him but he does not like it at all he says the feel of it is off and it does not stay connected ,1

i listen to everything from podcasts to classical rock and metal on this speaker it has great full range including an impressive bass response the treble is pretty directional and the sound isn hi fi for critical listening very happy with the small size and portability can carry this thing around the house or back yard and have my music wherever go overall very satisfied ,1
i read the reviews and ordered two one for home one for office they both worked great for about weeks started having trouble with the charge not lasting and then by the time my return window expired they were both worthless can still plug in and the lights are pretty perhaps very weak night light that is what the star is for the pretty lights ,5

i really like this keyboard it great because it pretty and lightweight don like that the charger is so weird though it has tendency to get loose that the only thing found wrong though don leave the power on don think this has sleep mode you ll come back and this thing will be stone dead lol always shut this off when done with it ,1
i received this on friday and let it charge all day saturday loved how it looked the lights were fun it was however very flat and small started using it on monday it was amazing so quiet so pretty here it is wednesday the lights no longer work and it is already dead yes did power off every night much rather use battery operated mouse ,5
i seen in the description that it said it would work for xbox one went no further after receiving the head phones we noticed it did not work for xbox one so opened the instructions and there we seen that an adapter is needed for xbox one and it is dont buy these for xbox as between this and the adapter you will spend almost ,1
i use this at work and it bumps love that can just toss it in my bag and go with it even set it up in my car spilled water in my bag and of course the jbl was fine still learning new things about it haven tested it outside yet but so far it perfect ve been using it for about almost months now ,5
i ve bought jbl charge speakers over the past years and one flip which is sort of still working and the first two after admitted heavy daily use just stopped working as the item is not easily opened by design or repaired don feel there is any option other than buying other one for usd anyone have any luck getting them repaired after they die ,5
i was looking forward to not having to use batteries and not have to worry about wires it was great at first and really liked it then after about week the charge did not even last day and then it quit even charging don waste your money the only silver lining is that had used my reward points so there was no out of pocket ,5

i wrote this because my friends think spent lot more money than did on this on nightly basis have box fan blowing directly on me and like to watch stuff on my tablet while hanging out with my friends in voice chat none of them knew had fan on and the tablet inches from my face is also not heard this is really great value ,5
is came with one side of the headset not working then when speaking into the mic the other party couldn hear what was being said recommend maybe different one if this worked for you great but on my end it didn the box came little beat up looking too also very light weight feel like they would have broke easily sent it back for refund ,5
it seemed to work ok for couple of days and then started noticing that it wasn moving my cursor where wanted it to go sometimes have to move it real fast just to find the cursor no matter what did it took an extraordinary amount of time to get it to land in the right spot gave up and started using my old mouse again ,5

it was important for me to have mouse that not only could see in the dark but something that was quiet also enjoy the fact that this mouse is rechargeable so this mouse will last me for the long run the light up feature is huge plus something didn know would appreciate since tend to work on my laptop in the dark great quality overall ,1

it was most important to me to have quiet scrolling mouse for my laptop this mouse has quiet silent scrolling and silent clicking very impressed the mouse is more of flat design the lights around it are pretty neat there is an on off switch on the bottom of the mouse that includes an option for the lights as well nice mouse for great price ,5

it was okay at first it lagged lot know it wasn an issue with my laptop cause ve used wireless mouses of different types before so got this one after few days it completely stopped working even after charging it it refused to connect and work definitely won buy this again and letting my friend know not to get it either it was just letdown ,1
like the size and ease of using it to travel with took it to broken bow and it worked great on the outdoor patio sound does break up some the more bass you have it really depends on what room you are in for the sound of this thing some environments are better then other easy connectivity and we have enjoyed it would recommend it ,1
order my fourth pair all three pair of blue ones head phone jack has shortage in them once take them out the box and cause sound to go in and out the last pair order returned for another pair and just got them yesterday and they are doing the same thing so going to return them for my money back think it is bad business ,5
pros significantly cheaper backlit keys rechargeable looks good sturdycons off brand name keys feel little plasticy battery life is little light not bad just don expect it to last for weeks without charging that it ve had two now after many logitech backlit wireless keyboards and for half the price or less can safely safe that logitech the big name is absolute garbage in comparison ,1
so bought two different mouse to use one for my laptop and one for my pc the originally bought this one for my desktop to match my rgb but enjoy using it with my laptop much better it is the perfect size for my hand you cannot go wrong at this price for what you get enjoy the noiseless aspect and the light weight feel ,5

sound is muffled lights vibrant but useless unless you re connecting to laptop for gaming the split is too short to connect it to the console what makes it light up and simultaneously to the gaming controller what makes it useful so for gaming the lights will not be on while wearing the headset mic like so many other complaints doesn work returning this item ,5
started out and loved this mouse butwithin months it would not hold charge for more tha few hours annoying having to use it plugged in bought this for the convenience of only having to rechage every couple of days to this in unacceptable if it was even once day could handle it since like the mouse but can stand charging every few hours so sad ,5

the center scroll wheel lasted less than week the mouse itself still works but it is aggravating that every time you use muscle memory to scroll with wheel that doesn work decent battery life bought new different brand mouse to replace it the mouse also doesn have much of an arch to it so its not very ergonomic its better than laptop track pad though ,1

the enter button is huge issue love the keyboard except for the place and shape of the enter key my finger hits that button and the enter button all the time the keyboard is perfect in everything else just can get passed that part returned the keyboard and ordered klim light rechargeable wireless keyboard us layout for that one has fix the enter button issue ,5
the headphones work as headphones the mic is so poor though that it barely works no one can hear me unless yell now wasn expecting amazing mic quality but it simply does not work was on pc using the splitter it came with and then another splitter owned both work just not the headphones compete on my school esports team and these flopped during practice,1
the main thing for me is that it is really pretty maybe that just girl reason to like it but am girl and an artist and maybe wee bit eccentric want stuff around me to add to my environment especially now other than that well its mouse it does all the same things other computer mice do and it does it well and its pretty ,1

the mouse is not effective charged for hours still no life or function do not buy when noticed that the mouse was not working charged it for hours tried the mouse again and it still did not work but showed red as one of the colors which may be warning the seller did not respond or reply to assist me with any troubleshooting unsatisfied customer ,5

the mouse is really quiet no clicking sound which liked comfortable for the hand does not hold charge very long and nothing worse than not responding during middle of the work day had tried to different brands the other was one that had bluetooth feature so could use it on my tablet that held charge all week and will be getting another one of those ,1

the mouse worked great loved it actually but the charging cord is severed and while it does charge it also will shock you little if you accidentally touch it while plugging into charging port or plugging the mouse in and because the charging cord is only inches hard to refrain from touching where it is severed will stop using this when new different mouse arrives ,1
the noise canceling is false at first when used them they were good owned pairs of these and the same problem happened with both after while the sound only goes to one side you have to mess with the volume adjustment to get both sides to work if you move it even little it only works on one side again will not be buying again,1
the overall sound quality is nice and loud indoors but when outside the sound doesn travel as far as you would think but for the size of the speaker was really impressed with the output overall when paired with nd device got the sound needed and wanted outdoors this is great product the portability is amazing because of the size and the durability is awesome ,5
the scroller broke and only used it about times in total the rest of the time it sits in my bag the lights are dim don like how small it is it does not have the best tracking the clicking is louder than expected it also just feels cheap would not buy it if could do it again go for more quality one somewhere else ,1

the speaker is faulty it won turn off if press the power button it just turns right back on some of the buttons don work properly either pressing the volume down button shuts the power off and still it turns back on automatically it annoyingto hear the startup sound and shut down sounds all day and night as it turns itself on and off automatically ,5
there is no audible warning when the battery is low the indicator lights are at the bottom of the speaker the way you know is when the speaker turns off in the middle of the night and you fumble with the charger while the speaker keeps turning off until the battery gets charge sound quality is nothing special considering the price and the jbl brand ,5
these headphones were comfortable had great quality sound and was convenient what didn like however is that you cannot change the cable on the headset after couple of months the wire that connects to the audio jack was so weak it stops working would keep using these headphones if it wasn for the fact that you cannot ever change the cable if it gets damaged ,5
these work great good shutting out noises they sound great you can tell the suround sound good bass only down side to me is they seem to be made for laptop cause the the usb cord for the lights is super short for controller use you could put one of those power bars on it button it just hangs there other then that great buy,5
they keyboard works fine able to maintain connection and battery life is fine the spring or what ever is supporting the space bar can be improved feels very weak and need to make sure space bar is pressed in certain area for it to register command this is fine for web browsing or working on word documents however this can be burdensome when playing games,5
this is compact slim mouse wouldn call it ergonomic just efficiently sized just opened it and already hate it it isn silent the buttons are loud and non responsive ve had to click multiple times to get response from the mhouse and only heavy loud click works ll be returning and will continue the hunt for replacement mouse it does look cool but performs poorly ,5

this is the most inconsistent keyboard ever it worked fine for the first months but now it only seems to work when it wants to that terrible for gaming you ll be in game and out of nowhere your character is taking damage and you re like what the hell ive had this for about months and its already failing on me can recommend this ,5
this mouse was pretty great when first got it worked well went quite while without needing to charge quiet etc however months later it acting up almost constantly it skips around the screen and sometimes turns itself off like there an electrical short somewhere obviously too late to return but wanted to update my rating this wasn expensive but it shouldn act like it disposable ,5
this thing works better than expected so many complaints about the bass but it seems very good for what it is after all it not dj speaker at club had this out for no more than minutes before accidentally dropped it in hot tub panicked at first but then remembered it is waterproof after the water wicked off it kept bumping very impressed so far ,5
well am not gamer but am coder and was looking for good keyboard tried variety of them but this one is the best its ideal for typing and the light does not pinch you eyes in the dark it has the option to adjust the brightness level and you change the colors according to your need all in all love it and would recommend it ,5
when received this item it was thin which is okay but it was also chipped off on the left side then simple drop and the mouse damn near shattered and to stop it off sometimes the cursor goes everywhere which can be annoying when you re working on particular items love it for the lights and how compact it is handle this item with care ,1

as advertised love that you can really hear the clicks charge it once week and use it approx to hrs week on color changing setting easy set up would buy again only thing don like is the short charging cable which is personal preference you would need usb plug right next to the mouse if you still need to use it while it charging ,1

battery life is not hours dies after playing at the pool for hours everyone once in while the sound cuts in and out like my phone is too far away except it will be within range recommend getting something similar at lower price point because am not satisfied also what with these companies assuming that we have extra charging blocks to plug in cords ,5
bought this mouse because when my other one died remember having to change my battery at least once month after getting this originally charged and has kept the charge for almost month now and just had to recharge for the st time charged overnight and working great again love this small quiet mouse easy to hold with rubberized texture that keeps it from slipping ,5

can respond to battery life haven had it but day but sounds great seems like great speaker been listening to all evening if it has good battery life would definitely buy again update made sure battery was fully charged today lasted hrs playing at about half volume still had over of battery life left thinking gonna love this speaker if it has any durability,5
horrible the first keyboard that got had dysfunctional key they did do good job of replacing it however the battery ran out and then the charger didn work as it happened ups didn do good job of picking up the old keyboard so still had that charger neither charger worked awful so much for their qa process that the company speaks so highly of ,1
i am very disappointed with the quality of life this mouse has bought it and was only able to use it four or five times and it has been problem for me ever since ve charged it adequately and it won start not sure if its factory malfunction or not but it should still be working ve owned it for little over month now ,1

i bought bought it as gift for my husband but use it sometimes it not too loud very portable he loved that we take it to the beach with us every time we go easily connects to bluetooth the battery last very good while my only dislike was that when vacuum doesn play loud enough to hear it over the noise of my vacuum ,5
i bought this mouse for college and received it promptly opened the package and plugged it into my computer and it worked kinda the next morning tried to use it in class and it would not work thought maybe that this mouse was dead so charged it and it will not charge and will not work this mouse is terrible product do not buy ,1
i bought this speaker to use at the beach as both sound system and recharger for my iphone it works great clear crisp sound deep bass and super long battery life when the iphone battery gets low this speaker recharges and plays all at the same time bought carrying case and protective rubber bumper to keep it safe during transport highly recommend this speaker ,5
i can say enough good things about this speaker after months of heavy use at home and outdoors it still looks and sounds like new it loud enough to use at parties yet small enough to carry around the battery seems to last forever listen to it all day and use it to charge my phone only have to charge my speaker once week ,5
i got this because our child sleeps while work the mouse is super quiet pro quiet lef right buttons adjustable sensitivity micro usb is easy to charge and doesn interfere with mouse use color changes usb doesn disconnectcons middle button click is louder color can be set it rotates it be cool if could lock it in for this price it pretty good purchase ,5

i have small head but that isn anyone fault it just doesn fit well even on the smallest setting the ear pieces rest too low which probably wouldn be big issue but have glasses as well and it presses to hard on my glasses just think they could have designed it with more flex in the size expansion thingies is all otherwise its good ,1
i love this mouse the only reason gave it star rating is because the scroll wheel is opposite when scroll forward away from me the page goes down and when scroll backwards towards me the page goes up getting used to it but rather it just be like normal mouse is there any way to fix this or does anyone else have this problem ,5

i love this speaker the battery lasts for days and days can use this for at least six hrs day for days before have to charge it never had an issue connecting with bluetooth to my laptop phone or tv it little larger than my old jbl but that fine don travel with it too often and when do it fits neatly into backpack ,1
i purchased this mouse thinking it had usb connector not usb with usb adaptor my bad opted to keep it three stars on its scrolling as it was not smooth but it worked would have kept it but after couple of weeks it died and would not charge despite being plugged in for hours don waste your money go with tried and true brand,5

i took my charge speaker camping with me and was really happy with how it sounded and how easy it was to charge my phone with it buddy of mine had another jbl speaker and we were able to connect them using the app and it was game changer we had occasional spots where the music got garbled but overall it was great experience ,5
i used these headphones for gaming and they were by far the best headphones especially considering it price the earmuffs fit nicely on my ears and are very comfortable what would make these headphones even better would be the ability to change how high low you want the sound of the game versus the sound of voice chat and vice versa like ps headphones ,5
i ve had this mouse for less than month and now it won work loved this mouse at the beginning never had problem with it and it was super cute now it turns on and everything and is also fully charged fyi and it won move at all on my laptop just when need it for huge work project and can use it bummer ,5

i ve owned several speakers from several different brands but this is the best one yet the sound quality is phenomenal for its size the battery life is great too took it out of the box on between battery and played it for over hours before it finally died ll be buying another to utilize stereo mode with the jbl app another great feature ,5
i was excited to get mouse that was usb charge instead of batteries ive charged it once and it worked great for about week which is awesome but have been trying to charge it now for days and it will not accept charge im past my return window and cannot get my money back or exchange it for new one this is big bummer ,5

just go to your local department store when opened the package and inspected the mouse it had obvious scratches and looked like there was some wear on the bottom it works and gets the job done bought this mouse because was tired of buying batteries for another wireless mouse the mouse will not work when you have it plugged into the computer to charge ,5

keyboard did not want to work even after turning it on and off and restarting my computer usb was plugged in but could not type word even tried charging it and still nothing and just got it today when went to settings it showed the keyboard was there but wasn allowing me to type or even change the brightness of the lights on keyboard,5
pros wireless ease of use feels nice soft smooth sleek dampened click quietcons it has very loud scroll button the wheel works fine but the button is difficult to press down and is quite loud so it slightly defeats the purpose of quiet mouse no additional buttons such as back or forward additional you have to charge the mouse with the included usb charger,1

the charge does not give the same bass and sound quality as the boombox but is really quite awesome in its own respect when you consider it is only the size of small thermos this baby really puts out great for picnics poolside and anywhere you want compact source of music was really impressed with the sound ain your grandpa radio that for sure ,5
the good decent sound quality and relatively comfortable the bad uses an analogue jack for the speakers making plugging it into certain devices difficult or impossible without an add on like splitter the microphone is an inflexible piece of plastic and people talk to online complain about my voice being muffled and distorted overall overpriced for what amounts to an okay pair of headphones ,5
the keyboard remains responsive and in perfect working order after month of regular use do have fancy logitech gaming keyboard with all the bells and whistles but prefer the quiet keys of the klim quiet doesn mean unresponsive in this case the keys feels sturdy and satisfying love that it uses usb for charging or wired gaming and the battery life is surprisingly long ,5
this headset is so big and bulky especially for kid the audio is fine and is better than most budget headsets the mic started having static issues after months every time you slightly move the cable the static is incredibly loud through the mic to the people you re playing with that tells me the internal components are poor quality or poorly put together ,5
this product wasn terrible as it had good sound quality but the fact of the matter is got it last august and all of sudden it just stopped working while in an xbox party with my friends had headset before this that stopped working but it lasted more than years this headset not even lasting months is an embarrassment and wish bought another headset,5
very nice quality both in sound and rugged design construction big sound even in large room battery lasts long time easy bluetooth connection to my iphone works every time with no hassle typical bluetooth range its fine as long as the phone and speaker are in the same room almost all bluetooth things are that way unless they have stick antenna and cost lot ,1
while this keyboard is good it not silent like the description says also the shape of the enter key is awkward and don like it but that is from personal perspective on like dislike for the shape it by no means takes away from the effectiveness of the keyboard will be looking for another one similar to this one maybe even the same brand ,5
works great it not very sturdy or high quality but you get what you pay for also within minute not sure how much time exactly the lights won stay on it ll dim on you which don like you can change the settings to have slow blink or solid blink but it will turn dark after so many seconds which not big fan of ,5
attached it to my bike for ragbrai works great like that its waterproof has long battery life charges my phone if needed and syncs with other jbl speakers within typical ft bluetooth range it gets pretty loud when you want it to but note that it only has one speaker so its mono not stereo sound unless you pair up two of them ,5
battery inside the mouse is it not recharable it not working after battery life gone so after months of usage it not working try to change the battery but it very difficult to change battery need to open the top cover and removing batter is not easy even after changed the battery also it not working it looks like one time use only ,1

beautifully produced and lovely to look at for mouse the lights are welcome addition to an otherwise drab workspace did notice that it tends to go into sleep mode quickly but takes longer wake up time than expect on screen busy with windows the cursor freezes in position until the mouse fully comes back to life it frustrating for anyone who isn patient ,1

everything works great except for the mic the mic wont transmit at all the customer service however contacted me shortly and refunded me for my purchase as well as apologized know that sometimes issues happen and its the way that companies fix things that make big difference they did right by me and salute themfor that will definately do business with them again ,1
got them for use with my children who seem to destroy headphones by looking at them integrated mic works well for class and they are comfortable enough to be worn or the whole school day the cord is long enough it not getting yanked out all the time and it feels more durable than some of the thin wires on most inexpensive sets ,5
great sound it simplicity is it key it is meant to be an outdoor speaker and to fill up wider area so don listen to those who complain it not stereo stereo is useless if it speakers are so close together it not too big the accessories you can buy are good like the rubber carry case and the hard case as well,5
had this for few months now still works perfectly stays charged for at least week and you can still use it while its plugged in charging ive dropped it few times and the cover has come off but snapped back on easily no damage perfect for use with my laptop if you dislike touchpads like do this is great solution for good price,5
i am very disappointed in this mouse while using it the mouse will constantly stop working and will have to turn it off and on just to get it to work again this happens at least times day as well the battery life is not long at all if do not charge it every night it will not work in the morning avoid ,5

i have had the flip for year and can say one bad thing about this product the sound is amazing excellent bass you can turn up the speaker as loud as you want no distortion range is at least feet my laptop that is the source is inside near window unbelievable range have only run out of battery twice after hours of usage ,5
i have had this mouse for month and other than like the colors it is worthless have tried every kind of surface and mouse pad and the performance is very erratic tried recharging and it is no better and today it just died in the middle of zoom meeting was hosting am flushing it and making note to never purchase this brand again ,5

i like everything about it except the ctrl commands seem to go haywire on my macbook the ctrl windows and alt buttons all sometimes seem to function in the same way but it not consistent one works to copy another works to paste it is unfortunate because like the look and feel of it but just can get much work done using it ,5
i needed new headset for both my work pc and for my ps this is the one my co workers can hear me loud and clear and my gf doesn throw things at me because she sleeping and the rats have eaten me again and don hear her snoring while stealthing my way through village very comfortable fit even on my giant noggin ,5

i purchased this in july and it worked perfectly it now ass backwards you have to hold the button down just in order to move the cursor if let go of the button it does nothing its completely off track the led only works when it charging before it worked whenever it was on the last switch on the bottom of the mouse ,5

i really liked using this mouse it died hair quicker than like but would just use it wired while it charged up however month after using it the middle scroll circle clicked down and wouldn come back up making it impossible for me to use as use that often in playing sims didn expect much as didn pay much but was slightly disappointed ,5

i thought would give these try but the mic is difficult because have to yell for it to pick up my voice or have to mute then unmute for mic to work because randomly it stops then it so tight on my head got headache in min it was so uncomfortable to wear my cheap turtle beach ones are better just don recommend ,1
i use this mouse when travel it is great to haul around when on the go the small form lets it easily slip in to my backpack and the dongle holder on the mouse makes the set up and tear down quick and easy if you are looking for mouse to use for light work while on the road this is good choice ,1
i was super excited for this mouse its so sleek and small it was perfect for me unfortunately it doesn work all that well its super glitchy especially when you turn it on color mode it lags and sometimes it doesn even click on what you re trying to click on its much easier to just use my mouse pad on my computer ,5

im giving this because got one in black for my sister and she hasnt had any issues bought one in blue and the left click sticks not sure if it was dropped at some point prior to me receiving it or if there is inconsistent quality with the product at the price its not worth the hassle of returning it to get replacement ,5
it doesn have tail so it more of hamster but it is very nice hamster it lights up really nicely and it is very accurate control of the cursor can speak on it for gaming as only use it for working from home but did like it enough to buy one for my work desk as well obviously did indeed by it again ,5

it exactly as bad as should have expected for the price ve had it for days and it will randomly stop working have to turn it off and on again to get the mouse to begin working again the plastic it made out of is cheaper than it looks in the picture honestly should have spent few more bucks and bought something better ,1

likes no noise click lights look cool chargeabledislikes chargeable battery life is very short had to turn off every time don use it or else battery runs out super fast within days after months the charging outlet is broken there no way to fix it now can use it anymore safer to go back to traditional battery mouse which lasts for long time ,1

looks pretty but not very responsive use it at work and have to back up and re read everything type as it misses letters adds extras if you even brush them with your finger which is the only time it works really well and spend way more time than should proof reading to make sure the keyboard isn making look like can type ,1
love it while it worked great quality suddenly stopped holding charge nothing happened to it obviously could be coincidence that it happened right after warranty expiration but suspicious enough that think will buy different brand in the future after good experience this one had bought another maybe months ago and we ll have to see if that lasts more than year now too,1
not what you want do not order nothing explained correctly at all you cannot light it up unless you can play your box looking at it from behind usb only for the light computer usb too many wires and too short too enjoy do not buy you will be very disappointed buy lot from amazon but will not buy bengoo products ever again ,1
perfect for gaming minecraft youtuber and these were perfect for my channel they fitted nicely for any size and were adjustable the sound cancellation was really good could nt hear any of the background noise while working as soon as put them on noticed difference in the sound it was so much nicer and clearer when had them on best headphones out there ,5
pros super great sound pretty noise cancelling great volume mic is decent for the price and filters out exterior sound pretty wellcons super tight on ears keep having to take them off to pop my ears even though my ears are tiny it works far better with my laptop alienware than my pc ibuypower but doubt that to the fault of the headphones ,5
randomly stopped working during my work day the keyboard still lights up when you type but it like my computer stopped recognizing it even after plugged it in tried different things found on the web to troubleshoot but still can type when went online saw many many posts of users experiencing the same issue so based on that would not recommend buying this ,1
so got this to replace my drab old keyboard and glad did the fact that it rechargeable was big sell for me and the very light texture feel nice to touch the only problem though not game changer for me having is that the main enter button feels further away or maybe it smaller than what used to but overall it thumbs up ,5
the usb plug broke after one use plugged it into my chromebook usb port and when went to remove it the metal stayed in the laptop super disappointed was so happy with it up until that point cheaply made unfortunately the mouse itself was cute colors were nice but when it wireless the usb plug has to be good quality or it useless ,5
the wheel button feels like it requires the force to activate and makes the noise of the other buttons whoever approved this should be fired straight into the sun the wheel button gets more use in cad software than any other button and not even minutes of use and the wrist is already strained to the point where can not continue to work ,5

these were in my desired price point dirt cheap and they have exceeded my expectations bought two pairs so my kid and could play co op missions on the switch together the noise cancelling works pretty well although definitely didn buy them for that feature microphone comes in clear and the volume knob and mic mute button are easy to reach very impressed ,5
this is great the jbl charge sounds fantastic with clear crisp sound and bass that will keep even the hardiest rockers or listeners quite happy and it lasts forever on full charge we ll not literally but longer than any other chargeable device have ever owned it won die in the middle of your beach party four thumbs up from this music lover ,5
thought these were good deal volume out works great however the mic is an out of box failure no one can hear me at all tried on pc and xbox my old headset the cord was chewed in half by our cat held the wires together on our old set and people could hear me better than with this set do not buy ,1
very pleased with the keyboards feel and function simple yet durable feeling and the mechanical feel is great also must say that quite enjoyed learning about the team of specialists in the provided documents quite funny and entertaining have placed probably over orders over amazon and do not generally leave reviews but this company stuck out so wanted to give them shout out ,5
was decent first month very flat so not ergonomic but that personal taste issue is this is already broken the scroll wheel no longer works even for mouse that pretty pathetic since ve had other mouses for years at time had the same issue as other reviews with the cursor randomly jumping too so there might be some design issue with the sensor ,1

yes do it buy em the audio quality is outstanding pretty experienced in av ans high end audio and these arent disappointingfoe the price the range is excellent the ability to link multiple units always impresses guest should be sponsored because ve had about friends buy these once they heard them take them to the beach on vacation in hotels the park powerful ,5
after only months my mouse no longer works am so upset because loveddddd this mouse it slim and fits in my laptop bag easily and everything it checked off everything on my list but no matter how long charge it now it will flash and stop working so sad and now the return window has passed and now can even return it ,1

bought this for my fianc for christmas ordered the navy blue one was greatly surprised how wonderful the sound quality was plus it has good bass for smaller speaker it actually pretty loud we never really have to turn it all the way up inside the house my fianc loves that he can charge his phone with it also would purchase again ,5
does not pair well at all with jbl connect bought this to connect to my jbl boombox it paired and did the whole jbl connect which jbl specifically offers it worked for about month then started having problems connection was lost in minute distortion even had them just foot apart and still dissapointing buy it for solo use not for jbl connect ,5
everything works great except one thing microphone cannot eliminate the noise from my surrounding when play apex legend with my brother he is always ranting me about the sound of pedestal fan like beeping sound that he can hear from my microphone when turn on the pedestal fan hope this review helps everything works great except for poor noise reduction of microphone ,1
for the price realized could have gotten something lot better it cheaply made glitches even with full charge got the white one and wish would have read the reviews before hand because it does indeed show the whole internal lighting unit which just adds the the cheapness of it it does the job still all considering just think it value is overestimated ,1

great sound not completely sound canceling but not bad thing as my partner is always trying to get my attention and now if he close enough can still hear him over the game the mic works great and sounds clear the cable is long and slightly cumbersome as the mute volume panel is huge but overall it great headset would purchase again ,5
have had this key board for about month now and only had to charge it one time after the initial charge while having the pulsing effect on although do not type long messages out like this all day long do use the key board pretty frequently switches feel extremely smooth as well will update again for its use in the long term ,5
headphones clear sound working as intended microphone microphone performance is abysmal my friends could not understand me switched back to my last microphone to solve this issue verdict this headset if it did not have terrible microphone or did not have mic at all would be solid piece of equipment if you can find headset with better microphone quality grab that instead ,1
i actually bought two large outdoor speakers for my husband for christmas for our lanai and he wanted to return them for one of these we have second and we connected both to our tv and honestly it created really nice surround sound effect without wires great product also bought some for my nieces and nephews last christmas and they were hit ,5
i am so angry now the battery life was short had to charge very short time after first use it was out of battery again today so changed it it worked for about minutes after charged then stopped responding tried all usb ports of my laptop all working so it the keyboard tried wireless or wired doesn work it just doesn work ,5
i bought this as birthday gift for my mom she said she wanted portable speaker with great sound found this gem and very impressed it arrived quickly and my mom tried it out right away so glad it came charged btw connectivity was fast and easy sound is amazing she in love with it and thinking of getting myself one as well ,1
i bought this headset few days ago and this is by far the worst headset have ever owned the sound in game is horrible and my friends can hear my in game sounds though the headset also it hurts my ears the padding is not very good can stand this headset threw mine in the trash and will be buying different one ,5
i bought this mouse for friend he she loves it it is better than the mouse that comes built into he her laptop plus it was brought as replacement for it as for my friend she tells me that she loves that it saves her lot of money on batteries she also loves the cool extra lights it has features on it ,5

i didn even notice until started typing on it but the forward slash key is to the left of the enter key instead of above so always accidentally hit it instead of the enter key nothing bad to say about the keyboard otherwise just strange design ll probably hang onto it as backup but the weird key placement is dealbreaker for me ,1
i dont usually give feedback but this one has to be my worst purchase in long time despite of all the positive reviews got my keyboard in november many times have got letters being typed double few days ago the keyboard just stopped working no more lights no more signal and no more life that keyboard went straight to the trash can ,1
i know it is better to give than to receive and am so happy my mother in law loved this gift she was used to staticky radio broadcasts of her favorite programs this speaker sounds so much better than mine now want one the battery life is impressive and the sound quality is great hard to believe this thing is splash proof ,5
i like that this mouse has sleek look to it slim ergonomic good quality not cheap looking like the color options available very easy set up ve been using it for couple of weeks now and it works great have not used it for gaming great price and will likely buy my next mouse for different computer have from the same place ,5

i love the product but love the customer service even more had an issue with the usb clearly my fault and lolita and her customer service team was truly amazing helping me to resolve the issue the are all truly amazing even sent me candy after few weeks of putting up with me and assisting me with my wireless light up keyboard ,1
i love the speaker and have one already in this case had to get one for friend with amzn for specific reason but the price charged is grossly over priced could have gotten one at walmart for all day long but had to use amzn for friend why does amzn allow this level of gouging other wise perfect speaker for my purposes ,5
i professional musician and spend lot of time listening to music with critical ear didn expect much from the jbl but was surprised at the sound quality pumped out by this compact unit connected to my phone effortlessly good bass tones and definition in the highs gets pretty loud too highly recommend for when you want music away from your home base ,1
i purchased this keyboard in nov and have really loved it it is quiet and well back lit and just fun to use because of how colorful it is sad to say it less than year in it will no longer hold charge so it is only usable when plugged in still good buy but just sad that it didn last year,1
i read lot of the reviews before decide to buy this item so far have no regrets people complain about the mouse turning off and the lights being on so when got the mouse noticed that there was an off button for the lights if you think about it you are saving power when your not using it would recommend the product ,5
i really liked that it was easy to set up really disliked the instructions which left much to be desired once figured out the problem myself setup was easy and seamless really like the way it looks and the ease of operation it only been in use for one day so guess will keep hoping that it works as well over time ,5

i was just trying to buy cheap mic until could afford really nice one turns out don need nice mic any time soon it has crisp audio for gaming it works on the playstation xbox one and even the pc ve had mics that weren half as good as this one if you on budget you can get anything better than this ,1
i was pleased to see just how well made the mouse was when received it couldn have asked for more for the money it comfortable in my hand the rubber texture really makes using it pleasure the dongle storage on the bottom of the mouse isn covered but it nice and tight so not worried about losing it so far so good ,5

i would be as bothered by the fact the charge switched to mono if they would ve at least centered the damn speaker blows my mind the majority of people that buy this will probably think the thing is broken because of that no way would pay full price for the charge when the is stereo much cheaper and likely sounds better ,5
just adquiere this speaker and really amazed by the sound quality and volume of this small device an enthusiast of sound and music and have years of experience listening and installing different sound sources either car audio and home can say that for sure that bigger equipment sound better but for the size of this can be more happy good bass reproduction ,5
loved the look and feel of this mouse but after only weeks of school the usb completely came apart when pulled it out of my son chromebook there was no impact or anything to cause this and the kiddo was quite upset that it broke because he loves the look of this mouse as well as how it feels in his hand ,5

many functions in many programs use ctrl shift ctrl shift does not work in any way on this keyboard this is unexpected and totally unacceptable behavior in keyboard these key combinations are intrinsic to many functions in windows it is time to return for refund darn liked the size and feel but functionality is compromised and need working keyboard not crippled one ,5
mouse doesn track well it also really flat and doesn feel good in my hand wish it had battery rather that cord or at least battery backup there is hard notch right below the when don know what it for bit it uncomfortable and gets in the way of using the wheel want to return but tossed the box it came in ,5
my husband uses this all the time we have used this almost daily inside and outside it quite loud no weenie tin box here actually like to get one more so we can sync them up and use them in two different areas hopefully soon hear that the new version won sync with the older model so please keep this one available ,5
not really ergonomic but don have an underlying issue where this is problem for me love the color changing aspect conversation piece and the charge lasts couple of days also turn it off when leave so really don know how long it really lasts but have not had any issues its mouse if you want it get it if you don don ,5

so when reading the reviews seen bunch of bad ones that were posted recently and it honestly scared me still got them anyways because don mind for how long they last but the mic is pretty good for now take care of my stuff so ll make this mic last for the time need it for but it from me so far ,5
that was my first review but the mouse did not work the seller replaced it immediately and that one works fine again be aware that this is rechargeable mouse and you cannot replace the batteriesthe seller should ve been clearer that this is recharging mouse and don know how you replace the rechargeable batteries so that the only complaintotherwise it great mouse,5

the colors are dang cool it doesn work with the xbox one series not an adapter wrote the seller and they took this very seriously and addressed my issues asap thank you so much sadly it just was not compatible with my xbox one giving them stars bc of the awesome customer service would buy from them again no problem thank you ,1
the keys are very quiet and the led add nice touch to the office however for typing occasionally do look at the keyboard to ensure of my hand placement is correct or to look at the key pad to punch numbers the downside is that the keys are pretty dark themselves so tough to see at glance overall happy with my purchase ,5
the mouse was working good and out of no where in the middle of me working it clicker just stop functioning unfortunately purchase this item on the th of january and my return window is now close really felt confident about this product and it is was nice while it lasted edit was spent replacement and it has given me any problems ,1

these headphones sound great and the noise cancellation is amazing but unfortunately the mic audio output full doesn seem to be good when play online on the xb with my friends they say my mic volume is too low after ve already adjusted the setting and have not had this issue with other mics great headset just wish the mic was better ,5
they do feel cheap and that ok for the price but the mic and sound are better than expected so you won be disappointed of you consider the price the mic is loud and clear and it does an amazing job at filtering my music playing on the background so it just picks up my voice and does not disturb other players ,5
this gives amazing sound the bass is clear heavy sound and the treble is crisp and sharp the volume is amazing too could fill room or patio the battery life is great many hours per charge the fact that it waterproof is an added bonus also my phone found it immediately no messing around or effort needed great buy for the price ,5
this is an amazing sounding speaker it has good base but not overpowering the sound is clear and deep it is mono speaker but can be paired with second one for stereo use it at work and am rarely able to go past half way at full volume with an iphone not sure if it matters it never distorts or sounds scratchy ,5
this is good unit nice bass good sound but had jbl charge three and do not like that cannot use the same charging wire for the amount of money that you charge for the gpo charge for it should come with its own charge wire should not have to go online and purchase charge wire separately or double usb cord let down,1
this is great back up set for when your good headset breaks the more you use this one the worse it gets at first it sounded great the glowed very bright but after few months there was lot of feed back in the mic and the surround sound didn work at all made gaming hard without being able to hear call outs ,5
this is quick responsive and easy to use mouse it can be run normally or with it built in lights sleeps after short period of unuse but wakes with single click micro usb charging cable included charges the mouse in no time light is on when charging and turns off when done with the sleep mode the battery lasts longer than expected ,5

this product fits like dream compared to the razer kraken line of headsets the mic isn as adjustable but prefer fixed mic as it won wear as badly and the mic quality seems comparable if not superior the cord is high quality as is the included adapter for being stock part they look just as cool as the photos aesthetically as well ,5
this product has been advertised as having led capability and it does but the lights are not bright enough that was the whole entire purpose of what had purchased this set for disappointing and considering beginning return plus the led lights engineered into this unity are barely colored purple and that is what classify as entirely weak kneed lackadaisical engineering prowess disappointing ,1
upon receiving the mouse charged it with the charging cable used it for considerable amount of time and plugged it in upon plugging it in there was an odd smell the smell was the cable starting to melt unplugged it and will not be using it again lucky that didn walk away or my place could have caught on fire what disappointment ,5

works amazing we have house full of various jbl speakers but wanted big one for our shed easy to use holds charge awesome super easy to pair and the blue color is perfect love that it has flat area on the bottom for stand with the controls on top ports have nice sturdy flap covering them to keep out dust and dirt,5
works good not great feels good if in small hand don have small hands the color led is cool buttt everything will bleed with the red of the eye use it work my work days hrs wk definitely have to change it every week of leave the led lights on might be able to get another wk if turn off the led,1
amazing headphone large sturdy headphone with comfortable ear padding for those all day weekend gaming session cool neon lights power indicator surprisingly crisp killer sound clarity and volume comparable to those found on premium gaming headset all for fraction of the cost will purchase many more as xmas presents for the nephews thank you bengoo for the affordable rop notched products ,5
battery and charge functions step up from next model down in the jbl bluetooth speakers sound appears to be same quality as model below this one heavier than lower model bigger because of battery if you don need the features of the battery and charge options go with next model down in the jbl bluetooth speakers and save and less bulky,5
battery life is no good followed manufacturer procedure for the initial charge frequent disconnect from usb adapter lighting is about the only good thing constantly missing keystrokes while typing as it is right now as write this claims to be quite typing nope don get that either hard of hearing and its annoying would look somewhere else should ve returned it,1
constantly times out or goes to sleep and every time try to move it to use it again it takes me having to sit there and shake it for ten seconds at first not big deal but do that for few weeks and it incredibly frustrating went back to my old mouse ll know next time to pay for better mouse ,1

got this keyboard as replacement for previous wireless keyboard liked the multi colored backlight functionality however what do not like is that the lights turn off after about seconds of no use wanted this keyboard to stay lit up but it just doesn do that still works and functions like good keyboard just hoped that the lights would stay on longer ,1
great design fits great in your hand easy to use loved it for the month ve had it but the scroll button just started spinning the last time turned it on that button no longer works no scrolling for me left and right still work and holds great charge however need to scroll and it is just past my return date ,1
great feel full size keyboard that is wireless and has blacklighting bought this because several keys quit working on my laptop don really use this for gaming but love size and the feel of the keystrokes it also has built in battery so you can just recharge instead of having to replace batteries all the time very happy with this purchase ,5
great sound great battery strong construction fits well in packs if you ve done the research you know the differences between what you are looking for if you haven and skipped to reviews sound is better than the charge not as big or loud as the extreme but still impressive fatter and more rugged than the flip jbl is good brand ,5
i bought pink one and the color is just so cute it very easy to use plug the dongle into the usb port and the mouse works immediately it also has multi colored lights to help you from getting bored while working studying really like this product and high recommend for people who are looking to buy mouse with reasonable price ,5
i bought this mouse back in july to use with my laptop when was in class this would equate to few hours each week the mouse stopped working after about month and charged it overnight the blue light never turned off and now the mouse will not turn on or work at all such bummer because really liked everything about it ,5

i get so many compliments about this mouse move location to location for my job and it held up just fine quiet click smooth functionality fun color changing led love it the only negative is that the charging cord is short and doesn also operate the mouse when plugged in so make sure you have two usb plugs when needing charge ,5
i had this mouse before without the led lights worked like charm but despite this version that says the led lights are able to turn off they don the switch on the bottom to shut off the lights do not work the on button shuts off the whole mouse instead of just the lights so basically stuck with annoying flashing lights ,5

i have this speaker for months and used it total of times it stays in case in my room always somehow it has stopped working it is not charging and switches off after couple seconds one light blinks consistently during charging but it isn charged will not recommend anyone spend this amount of money on speaker that will just stop working,5
i like the looks feel and sounds of these headphones the cable could be longer and longer cable separation of the input usb and the ear jack would be an improvement the volume control is mispositioned for tall user as it gets in the way and is heavy on the cord otherwise these things are great and do highly recommend them ,5
i like this speaker it really has terrific range paired it with my computer and took it all the way to the back of the house and around the corner and it still great my one big complaint if you re paying this kind of money for speaker they can include charging cord with it have to buy separate one really ,5
i love the sound of this speaker deeply but the connection range is weak as hell feet away you start to lose connection volume wise between and it the same sound it doesn get louder love how it looks lot love the sound but the quality of the sound isn there for me little disappointed but it solid speaker all around ,5
i love the sound quality of this speaker was worried it wouldn sound good after reading several reviews about sound quality being just okay disagree the sound and bass this thing has is incredible my only suggestion would be to have more colors more feminine colors specifically one in darker shade of teal otherwise no complaints recommend this speaker to anyone ,5
i love these headphones just got them yesterday and im in love its so hard for me to find headpphones that dont squeeze my ears and give me headaches these bad boys do the job perfectly the sound is perfect level if dont like super loud headphones but you still get to enjoy the sound proof quality for yourself get them ,1
i love this bluetooth speaker so much but recently it has stopped charging ve done all of the trouble shooting and have handled it with care since got it really upset that can get it to charge anymore and now can even get it to stay on just outside of warranty upset don know if will be buying jbl again beware ,5
i purchased two of these one was refurbished and the other brand new surprisingly the refurbished one works flawlessly but the new one has many issues you have to twist around the aux plug in and it cuts out until you twist it again the mic cuts out as well some cracklings sounds wouldn purchase again only due to the unreliability ,1
i really liked this mouse when first got it it was low profile had nice soft and quiet click had rainbow lights and was available in rose gold color thought made great purchase now ve had it for less than months and the scroll wheel is so squeaky can stand to hear it when scrolling through documents bummed it was lemon ,5

i saw all the positive reviews and thought this would be winner at first it was great loved the colors it is easy to use but after few months the scroll wheel stopped working dug little deeper into the reviews and realized this is common theme now have to buy another mouse already and it won be another one of these ,1

i use this for my laptop needed silent wireless mouse it wireless and silent the roll ball button is loud like regular mouse but left and right are quiet charged it used it once the next day tried to charge it and cut it on it wouldn come on or the red light flashed and immediately went off wouldn buy this ,5
i use this headset for my ps and the microphone doesn work unfortunately my friends can barely hear my voice if not at all ve noticed the sound quality is very low as well even in high volume it doesn light up unless plugged into computer and when plugged into my laptop it doesn connect pray it ll get better soon ,5
i very happy with the keyboard got it was well packaged and is very easy to use do enjoy the minimal sound and the texture of the keys the only key that is bit harsh on the fingers in the space bar but the rest is very nice and smooth the lights go off whenever the keyboard is not in use ,1
i was looking for simple black led mouse for work and this one is exactly what was looking for it works great and have had no issues yet due to the size it can be little uncomfortable if you are doing lot of work using the mouse for an extended amount of time but this has only happened to me once ,1

if you want keyboard with backlighting then this is not the keyboard for you it does not stay backlit for more than minute when not being used which is more than annoying and the instructions as to programming it to stay on does not change anything in that regard sent it back and will be returning to tried and true logitech ,5
it does everything ordered it to do for good price rechargeability is huge plus to me for wireless mouse the clicks are satisfying and it feels nice to hold my only gripe is that the lights on it are bit weak but honestly don care about that in the slightest and that not why bought it so it not big deal ,5
love the size feel and color of this speaker it was very easy to connect to my phone and ve been quite impressed with the sound quality even more impressive is the battery life of this speaker can go days to weeks without charging depending on how much play music like that you can charge your phone off of it too ,5
my little brother got these for his birthday and absolutely loves them he takes em with him everywhere lol haven actually played with em but the one time had them on they seemed pretty comfortable as for noise canceling the boy can hear damn thing when he playing his games so be willing to wager they do good job at that ,1
my wife complains about how it charges sometimes it doesn get full charge that might have more to do with how she goes about it though one concern to be aware of though is how the watertight flap can pinch the charging connection she puts another usb cable into the out port to keep the flap off of the usb in,5
no sound canceling these are just regular headphones the audio jack is weirdly thicker than it should be so hard to plug into things and very snug when you do they re very light and cheap but you get what you pay for if you want gaming headphones look elsewhere if you just need headphones with mic these are technically fine ,5
overall great product really like the feature of connecting another to it take this on bike rides and my buddy who has one shares music on both speakers as we ride it has one speaker but sounds great in small to medium size rooms this thing holds it charge and great feature is that it also battery pack for cell phones ,5
quick and easy set up just unbox and plug into usb port then game away charging cord is little short but it does has samsung charging port not sure what type it is maybe so getting longer charging cord is no issue no lag between key presses and was shipped in good sturdy box with stickers and personal note from company ,5
so all in all for this thing is fine the rgb is not actually rgb instead featuring the average rgb rainbow cannot customize the coloration just the brightness and the pattern pulse breathing something along those lines all that said this is fine budget option clicky bois beware this is not very tactile prefer it that way but know many dont,1
sound quality was so bad just bought razer you get stars automatically if have to use two in between wires engineering genius lets add more jacks usb which is the weakest link of every headphone in existence honestly you might as well pay for wireless then all this chinese crap that is gonna break in few months of wear and tear ,1
the design is pretty but the functionality is crappy my mouse censor keeps glitching in and out which makes it impossible to work with definitely will be returning which is really annoying because it took forever to arrive and it was supposed to be replacement for my previous wireless mouse that fell to its death from the nd floor last week ,1

the keyboard looks and feels nice to use however have barely uses this keyboard and am encountering connection issues open up web browser go to start typing and nothing happens turn it off and on again wait few seconds then again start typing it doesnt type then again few seconds and it registered letters other times it functions properly too unrealiable ,1
the keys are very soft when hitting which makes for nice feel to keyboard like that the sleep mode kicks in after minute or so of no use translating to longer battery life before having to plug in and charge the color does only stay at one spot it doesn breathe or anything will update in couple of weeks if needed ,1
the mouse is cool design with it lighting up as you move the mouse around my only grip with it is the mouse scroll wheel is not functional ve only had it for months and the scroll wheel stop working thought that with charging the unit it would fix the problem but to no eval unfortunately would not purchase this again ,1
the one ordered will only turn on if the switch is in strange position that is between the clicks had to move the switch carefully with two fingers until found the very small area where it turns on sending it back because its almost impossible to use if the switch gets moved it takes few minutes to turn it back on ,5

the wire was weak the part near the plug broke apart after months it is still functional but the wire is visibly damaged you can see the metal wire inside breaking apart the product description claims for it to have noise cancellation but that is lie every time use the headphones can still hear outside noise do not waste your money ,5
then were kidding when they said this was quiet keyboard after using it for less than days the keyboard squeezes on several keys when push it including the space bar it is very annoying so plan on trashing it since it is past the return date purchased this keyboard because wanted light up keyboard use it for work too much noise ,1
they are designed with mm jack and usb cable my gaming laptop has an output mm port and an input port for the mic normally use only usb headphones which is what thought this headset was apparently the usb only powers the lights useless will never buy from this company again they got my money which is all they were after ,5
this is my nd jbl bluetooth speaker also own the jbl charge love both speakers the sound is good for such small speaker small size easy to take along the battery is great can run this for hours on end and still more than charged think it has battery life and believe it waterproof too nothing but love for this speaker ,5
this is probably the single most frustrating headset have ever dealt with the mm jack fits loosely in dell workstation it is not wired correctly does not work in combo headset mic jack on the same workstation the usb connection is purely to power the leds ended up replacing with cheaper headset from reputable manufacturer and all of the issues ceased ,1
this is the second time purchase this mouse in matter of few months and the second one is already not working at all charged it and all and nothing have the rose gold one can you guys please send new one or refund me like the color matches my laptop well but refuse to keep re purchasing every other few months ,1
this is the second time purchase this mouse in matter of few months and the second one is already not working at all charged it and all and nothing have the rose gold one can you guys please send new one or refund me like the color matches my laptop well but refuse to keep re purchasing every other few months ,5
this mouse is lightweight easily connects and transports well for those on the go it being rechargeable means no searching for batteries and the feel of the mouse is comfortable and not bulky the lights are fun and you have the option to turn that on or off all in all this is great mouse with great value for the cost ,5
this speaker does not hold its charge and to top it off you can use it while charging have an anker speaker that was much cheaper and it actually works better had purchased the jlb for fathers day thinking it would be an upgrade for my husband but was proven wrong if the return window was still open would return it ,5
this speaker has amazing sound quality and is such an upgrade from my phone speaker use it in my home but it is also compact enough to be great for travel taking to the pool the beach and more my only complaint is that the battery life seems little short so often bring little portable charger for it on the go ,5
this speaker is what you would need if you want something thats loud but has great bass even on low volume this speaker has incredible bass the sound at just of the volume sounds really loud the battery life is as it promises in my experience played from of battery at percent of volume for up to days until it died,5
this unit works perfectly for what needed can bluetooth music over the air or wire into the aux to mix music in daw in real time without bluetooth latency went for the charge specifically for the aux so far no issues recorded track today with key midi keyboard and the headphone out of my computer to the charge works like charm ,1
this was pandemic lockdown buy my wife and were spending lot of time outside on our patio our happy hours were missing something great sounds this speaker delivers great sound at low mid and high range it can also play very loud although we keep the volume pretty low to be respectful of our neighbors would recommend this speaker to friend ,5
very nice sleek design was expecting lot more given the reviews but mouse stopped working after weeks the usb and usb adaptors are very flimsy and prone to bending so as soon as go to plug it into my computer it does not connect definitely would not recommend unless you are looking for product to use for about week or two ,1

 this being my first rgb product like it it surely not high end top of the line keyboard but it enjoyable for what it costs my only issue it fingerprint magnet and with it being black it too easy to see you can clean it well with non alcoholic solution though be sure to use gentle cloth to avoid smudging ,5
 works fine the first couple of weeks but now it doesn work connected with different cables and outlets and just show that is charging til the first two lights blinking but it doesn fully charge also try to reset it but reset it doesn worki usually never do review but don see my option the refund or get new one ,5
after months it started missing key stokes or double entering letters you would think it would last longer than months before having issues like this it is hard to respond quickly to things when you have to keep going back to correct words that are either missing letter or have too many letters quite disappointing time to find new keyboard ,1
as ve just learned by searching questions after using it for few weeks the scroll wheel stops working also these are silly lights for grownup they remind me of those kids shoes that light up when they step green pink yellow lights are kid or gamer colors every time try to save buck regret it off to buy new one ,1

bought this keyboard for my son who wanted wireless for gaming we let it charge for full day the first day it was fine though my son thought the lights would stay lit while he was using it the second day it was lagging in its responses we charged it again which helped but not for long we returned it ,1
clicking this mouse takes so much force have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it and if ever pick the mouse up off the pad my cursor moves erratically around even if it pointed at the ceiling literally the most important things for mouse pointing and clicking are useless on this thing looks nice though ,1

first the american flag and corporation website does not like to tell you where they make their products got the keyboard and it said made in china then proved it was made in china by the keystrokes not working demanded my money back and warn anyone to avoid china malfunctioning keyboard that pretends to be an american product not cool ,5

i bought two of these to use with our laptops both computers recognized them right away and we were able to use them easily like the variety of colors offered and the lower profile so my hand doesn cramp like it has with some other styles the light up colors are fun think it was good value for the money ,1
i got this headset for my year old son it has great surround sound quality the over ears design work well my work from home office shares the same space as my son games in this allows him to game after school quietly and headset cancels the sound of my work conversations they are conform able and work great the,5
i got this specifically since it was smaller than the gaming mouse had this slim mouse feels nicer in my hand the only thing is that occasionally the cursor lags jumps bit but it doesn happen too often otherwise love that it chargeable and wireless don keep the flashy lights on too often to conserve the battery nice cheap mouse ,5
i had my last one for years ended up breaking it but got another one and honestly for the price and how long it lasted as well as quality it definitely worth while buy gifted one to my little brother use this on my xbox and little brother uses it on his ps or pc we never have any issues ,5
i have this keyboard for desk setup with my laptop which is up on the desk shelf and the keyboard is in the slider under the desk and it won register anything type from that far litterally has no range looks nice like how it feels but won work kinda pissed don have the packaging to send it back either ,5
i love this speaker so many good things to say battery life is great sound quality is awesome and the think like the most is the bluetooth range have not seen any other device with such an impressive range am now building an abs pipe mount for my atv so that can just stop the jbl in and ride away ,5
i love this speaker took it to california and it is so easy and light to travel with the sound quality is amazing not only that but the battery life is soo good didn charge it the whole trip and used it for few hours each day have never had any problems with it so far but would highly recommend ,5
i ordered for work and for home they are great until died after months it indicated that it is charged but it does not function it might be bad switch they second died in less than months of use disposable batteries would be better for the environment than disposing of multiple rechargeable that stop working faster than battery runs out ,1

i really wanted to like this mouse as it lightweight and cute but it not worth it when the mouse charge dies quickly and since it not compatible with my macbook can use it while charging since have to use the same adapter for both sensor and charging also lights stopped changing colors and you can set to one color ,1

i started using this keyboard and it was perfect until hit the spacebar the spacebar makes rattling noise when you even touch it at all you don even have to press it down it unavoidable to make this sound no matter how gingerly you press the key unless this was single unit problem this design is garbage as silent keyboard ,1
i use this set for my work office work remotely and am in meetings all the time and this headset is very comfortable and works great my wife and dogs are in the house and the noise cancellation works great obviously not for the microphone when you aren on mute great buy recommended to co worker and you as well ,5
i was looking for replacement mouse as my old mouse stopped working properly when ordered this first received mouse that did not work properly it went into sleep mode every few seconds requiring me to switch it off and back on in order to work again for few seconds contacted the company and they sent me replacement which works perfectly ,1
initially was pleased with the feel and performance of this mouse it is lighter and slimmer than the typical usb wireless mouse and it worked well however after about two weeks the scrolling wheel became erratic and it stopped working altogether today bit more than three weeks in use as result the mouse became essentially useless and am returning it ,5
it charged within an hour or two out of the box like the lightweight slim feel of the mouse the storage of the usb clip is secure and pretty easy to get in out while it not important like the changing colors of the lights inside the mouse just fun feature so far it works great for the inexpensive price ,1
it not damaged the cord isn messed up but bought it and today it already done lol if connect it the sound doesn fully come through like as if you have to keep adjusting the cable like an old school broken ipod the mic isn working bc of this terrible would have rather bought another brand same price don buy ,5
it works fine the lights are little dim but that not big deal for me really wanted it because it looked cool it wireless and my old key board was pretty noisy this one looks cool but it just as noisy an english teacher and use the computer during study hall it still makes lot of noise in quiet room ,5
just received it yesterday but have already been using it to listen to music out in the patio the music is so crisp still need to adjust the settings on my phone to make sure get my moneys worth with quality have yet to test the range but was about away with wall in between and music was still going ,1
keys are very clickety loud and the space bar literally squeaks battery charge doesn last long and cuts out completely with no warning is not functional while charging plugged into the computer otherwise suppose it functional backlighting is nice to have though sure it drains the battery more quickly no obvious way to turn that feature off when not needed ,1
my first jbl speaker and plan on buying more after purchasing this one the battery on this thing is amazing excellent sound as expected from the jbl brand and great sound for the size phone always connects easy and charges it fast as well just want to buy more because hear jbl speakers connect fast and easy with one another ,5
needed wireless mouse for work laptop and this mouse gets the job done the price is very affordable and the product came very fast was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the clicking sound that should come in handy during the early mornings work days would recommend this mouse if anyone is trying to find something for their macbook usb port ,1

purchased two connection between the speakers is good but the bluetooth connection between the source is by far the worst have ever had constant clipping does not matter if ft apart or lot of sound when connected but will drive you crazy with the clipping not worth the money not even worth half the price do not buy my mistake ,5
so my jbl ve owned for about less than month now and now the speaker itself doesn charge at all the cords work with other devices just not the speaker assume jbl uses bad batteries for their devices regardless this is unacceptable for portable speaker at that price tldr just bought the speaker this month battery already having issues charging,5
straight out of the package had issues but figured would hold on the mouse does not move smoothly cannot click on things and then the mouse would move only intermittenly then it would stop and would have to jerk it around and now it has just stopped just upgrade spend little more on logi mouse and it is worth it ,5

super cute for an easy cheap alternative to gaming headset the sound quality is definitely not bad for the price if the game is loud enough noise surrounding you is practically canceled but not completely mute id say good for kids and good for quick need of headset in pinch headband is bit flimsy but definitely lasts for good while ,1
the headset itself is pretty but it big on my head without the ability to adjust the lights on mine don turn on no matter what do the sound quality isn bad it just isn loud at all even at the highest setting still use them for horror games but if you like your games loud wouldn recommend this headset ,5
the mid and high range is bit lower than expected however the bass levels help compensate to deliver good sound this is fantastic for the back patio and beach battery life span ha snot been fully tested but in uses has thus far drained my cell phone faster than the speaker the port in back can help charge as well,5
the mouse is slim and lightweight love the way that the inbuilt led light in the mouse changes its colors it is very easy to install the mouse on the laptop the day bought the mouse have been using it without charging the battery for days after surfing the mouse on amazon thought found the right mouse for my computer ,5

these units do not last and customer service is non existent unit was working fine then charged it and nothing zero sound and factory reset does nothing wrote email no response called factory support and no working telephone kind of hard to get warranty when no one is home this is the nd one to do this won be third ,1
this is great cordless mouse it is rechargeable as long as the computer is on there is place on the bottom to store the dongle if not in the computer if dropped it will come apart unfortunately it does fly in special education classroom stronger shell would be great also an extra dongle in case you lose the first one ,5
this mouse was very useful and relatively enjoyable the first week and half at two weeks it seemed to glitch the cursor would jerk and freeze so connected the mouse to the charger it was ok for couple of days but sadly succumbed to its cheapness this afternoon very cheaply made product maybe those star reviews are bought very disappointing ,1

this product is very cheaply made purchased this mouse because my daughter liked the lighting on the side of the mouse however the wheel that controls how you scroll up and down on web page easily breaks off and you have to return it or buy another one buyer beware take it from father who has went through of them ,1

use it lot listening to music on social media sometimes can be little muddy in sound but that may be the audio system from the social media site otherwise very satisfied there may be larger brands out there at much cheaper prices than the jbl advertising strong bass but the tonal quality of these cheaper speakers is not that great ,5
was little disappointed that there was no way to keep the lights on longer seconds just isn long enough for me give us the option to be able to keep the lights on all the time it just looks better also the lights aren very bright other than that its nice keyboard but not sure if ill be keeping it ,1
when playing with friends they can barely hear me even when speak loudly the mic itself is very short and only come halfway down my cheek with no way to extend it non functional for online play the sound is fine the quality of the mic as whole isn great but for not bad do not buy for online play ,5
while was excited about the headset sound quality could not wear it for more than few minutes it is extremely tight as result it kept pressing on my glasses shifting them around whenever moved my head additionally it pressed tightly on my earring which became painful very quickly if you have neither glasses nor earrings guess this is good option ,1
works great and connects instantly wish the lights were bit brighter and had an option to let them stay on they turn off after minute or so ve had this for months now and some of the buttons stopped working maybe have faulty one but prior to this it was doing it job great for price but it is cheap ,5
adorable little mouse however the darn thing will be on and won do anything know to click to wake it if it in sleep mode but half the time it won be asleep and have to click like times for it to start actually working unfortunately ll have to find another mouse because this has become an irritating inconvenience ,1

after two months of non regular use this mouse has already stopped working properly scroll wheel has completely stopped working on it own and now feels somewhat loose when touched was good while it worked and liked the color of it but only two months of use is unacceptable when there are other similar priced options from other companies ,1

as far as gaming is concerned not using it for that using it because have diabetic retinopathy and it helps with seeing the keys the brightness is perfect the battery life have not ran into problem have used it when my computer is docked and several days have gone by without charging it again so to me that great ,5
at first loved this mouse it worked great and the battery lasted long time but have bought of these now and the first one was faulty and this second one has only worked for about months and now will not connect this product would be fantastic if it worked longer that months but for the price it not terrible ,5
bought two of these one for work and one for my personal computer in two different colors mouse worked great until the roller ball in each died one after couple months one after less than two days if you can live without the roller ball then highly recommend but if you use it heavily would look at different mouse ,5

do not buy this mic someone who always checks reviews with this device check the questions apparently you need an adapter to use the headset in the first place which the seller does not include secondly even with the adapter most say that the mic stops working after little while even with the adapter highly recommend avoiding this product ,5
for the size of this unit and the design of the passive woofers the bass should be deeper mids and highs are clean bluetooth range is excellent maybe its because the drivers are parallel to the surface first facing upward downward have smaller the size single bluetooth speaker and it bass is excellent for its size it connects immediately ,5
great product my year old is new to gaming loves his keyboard the colors are fantastic he had great time with the included product stickers decking out his pc casing headphones etc plus the letter product literature that came with the keyboard personalizes the product you feel connection to the folks who put their tlc into the product thx ,5
honestly very surprised by the sound quality the noise cancelling would say is sometimes afraid can hear if someone calls me at home and the foam on the ear cups and the head part is really soft have longer head so these burly fit me but over all am really enjoying them now to see if they last long ,5
i am an adult with smaller head and sometimes feel like these headphones are slipping off when gaming but that is really the only complaint have tend to just use one of my beanies to keep it from slipping don like the cutesy headphones they make for smaller heads that why chose this one otherwise like these headphones alot ,5
i been cheap with my headsets but been looking for one to replace one that broke and paid lot of money for this one is really good if you play cod loek me its important to hear where the footsteps and coming from well here you go this is the best headset you will get for the reasonable price,5
i bought it in september and didn receive it not until september we are at october end it already went out not even month it started at the end of september with not keeping charge so kept cord in and charged during the day while working on it then stopped working turned off and on and just completely stopped ,1
i bought of these for my kids the one thing that attracted me most was the led lights once we noticed how it works and how short the cord is was disappointed keeping it because they still like it but now have to look for usb extension to see if that helps and could feel better about the product ,5
i bought this to play music to my daughters they enjoy to listen to their favorite songs here the sounds is of good quality and fills the entire living room in our home believe battery runs for about two days when we listen to music all day recommend it it is the perfect size to take it on trip ,1
i didn know it was possible to like mouse so much it is very comfortable and smooth the battery life is pretty long don like having to charge it because sometimes forget to plug it in and then it goes dead the battery life usually last around week as long as can remember to charge it it is fantastic ,1

i don consider myself an audiophile by any means but know what like connectivity with my sony nw was snap and the sound quality was quite surprise it was rich full sound and did not detect any distortion played everything from bocelli through journey bon jovi jason aldean and queen it all sounded great to me love this speaker ,5
i had solid green back lit keyboard that stopped working wanted another solid color but could not find one so bought this one that has multi color back light have to say like it better also the keys feel much more substantial and it has an on off switch that like as well works from decent distance also recommend ,5
i have been using this mouse for weeks now and have no complaints it goes to sleep on its own and comes back on easily with click no delays or problems connecting to bluetooth do wish had way to know what the battery life was but just hook it up every days and it hasn died on me yet ,1

i have logitech keyboard that use with no problem with my other mouse but when plug this mouse in the keyboard stops working the dongle is also hard to remove from the back of the mouse had to get something small to pry it out little space for your finger to grab it more easily would have been nice ,5
i have purchased many gaming headphones for my sons these are the first that not only work but work extremely well they were also the easiest to set up the sound quality is great and guessing that they have fabulous noise cancellation capabilities as my sons seem to not be able to hear me when they re wearing them ,5
i initially got this keyboard for my wife and all the work she was doing but her laptop keyboard had gone out this keyboard was so awesome and user friendly love the key impact love the light up nature and liked it so much that purchased one for myself for work it solid keyboard for the money great value ,1
i like the adjustable backlighting the way the keys feel and how quiet they are most of all like the klim technical support had trouble coordinating the chroma keyboard with the blaze mouse because of interference klim responded very quickly and their very first suggestion worked appreciate quality products and just as importantly prompt friendly and effective technical support ,5
i like this mouse because of the leds and the color but the usb converter that it comes with is not reliable had to use different one in order for the mouse to be usable have also noticed sometimes lag in clicks so wouldn suggest this for gaming or something where you need to be super responsive and precise,1

i love this little mouse very well built and sturdy dropped it twice and nothing happened to it the colors do not fade fun lighting reliable and very long charging battery life use it almost every day and haven had to charge it in weeks ended up buying another one for my daughter and it just as well made ,5

i loved the design and cool light features but true to the old saying you get what you pay for this mouse was pretty bad it jumps and skips all over the page and you have to click the left mouse button or times before it responds to your request very frustrating to say the least not good buy ,1

i realized was spending more money on cheaper less effective speakers finally invested in jbl honestly don regret the cost its by far the best speaker ve ever owned bike lot and love to use hammocks at the beach always have it hanging on strap you can hear it from long distance in loud environment do it purchase it ,5
i thought these were really good at first but the same week went to burlington coat factory and found turtle beach headset for once tried those on noticed big difference these ones have lot of background noise there is an echo that doesn go away and just the quality it different would go for different brand returned this pair ,5
i ve had it for about day now and it already been big use in my life ve so far used them to play games with my close friends and it great we can here each other clearly it also good for recording audio for things like animations and twitch streams these great pair of headphones and recommend them ,5
i wanted to love this mouse the first one randomly stopped working for no reason it was past the return window so bought another one hoping it was just fluke or that did something wrong even though sure didn bought second one and that one too stopped working randomly after the return window closed won be buying this again,5

is there valid customer support the website link goes to something completely different my usb plug fell apart and want to inquire about new one ve had this keyboard for about months and now cannot use it update klim responded immediately and is sending out new usb plug am impressed with the fast response and their willingness to help ,1
it says so in the info but if you re like me you go right to reviews lol have tested it with my ps fits great over my glasses ll update once use it more updatei forgot to update this before but these headphones works fine lights included they are comfortable and work with my android phone as well ,1
just ordered this as nice wireless mouse for my surface pro it works nice but when went to pull the usb out of the surface pro part of it stayed stuck in the port had to use pliers to pull it out not sure if this just tight fit or poor workmanship other than that the mouse works fine ,5
loud and clear outdoors up to away but don expect lot of bass its there but not deep the speakers are on the ends and just aren large enough to move that much air however the sq is very good love that the battery lasts hours its light weight and easy to transport great addition to our camping trips ,5
my mouse never worked charged it the first day for the recommended time when tried to use it it powered on briefly and then powered completely off thought it must not have charged completely so charged it again and again and again each time it did the same thing just threw it away never even got to use it ,5

my order came fast and on time use this little mouse at work all the time it is lightweight and slim enough to put in my scrub pocket for travel easy to clean only thing see is that cannot tell when the battery runs low keep an extra mouse handy for those times but other than that no complaints ,5

needed keyboard that was backlit but did not want just plain white use this for my desktop computer since am now working from home so can speak for gamers but for my job it been great the colors really pop and you can adjust the brightness or just turn off the color all together very happy with my purchase ,1
not great they don really fit snug on your ears no noise cancelation not very loud for gaming mic works good light is cool probably good for kids thought it was good deal on decent set but really they are just headset ill be returning them as they were not what was expecting or hoping for and don fit ,1
overall my son is very satisfied with his headphones he uses the with his nintendo switch and the sound quality is very good for the budget price these headphones go for the microphone is average so nothing special the lights look neat and they are very comfortable if you re looking for budget pair of gaming headphones would recommend ,5
overall this is great speaker it clear loud and pretty user friendly the battery seems to be pretty good at volume or less but close to the top of the volume range it really lacks in battery life when have it at charge and volume it will barely last me getting ready in the morning probably takes me minutes ,1
so definitely stars here the sould it really good they even fit my big head issue never thought had big ears but these don fit my ears right and after bit they start to hurt slightly just take min break and potty or something and then back at it played for hrs straight the first day can fault them ,5
so really like these head phones travel alot and they are useful on my switch and my phone my tv still has headphone jack so can use it there too and then gaming on the computer too it wonderful headphones need to be made like this ve fallen asleep with them on and they have not been damaged o,5
the colors are fun and different the thing did not like was that the default color is red if it is not in rainbow mode the material is okay it works at it should it is great that its rechargeable it holds charge for long time and if you forget to turn it off the sleep mode works well ,5

the cushion material is very uncomfortable after few minutes of wear it feels like your ears get hot quickly it seems it would have been easy to cover foam ear piece with more breathable material sound quality is great and the microphone seems to be perfect but sound quality means absolutely nothing if it is too uncomfortable to wear ,1
the headsey is very good for gaming the mic works great people on the other side have said they can hear me more clearly and can hear them more clearly with the amazing sound quality and when put it on and play something can almost always only hear whats in the headset over all would definitely buy this again ,5
the mouse itself is great works well however the roller ball on the top of the mouse broke and no longer works it has only been weeks since purchase do like that the lights have an on off function so you don need to have it lit all the time which makes it more appropriate when in work environment ,1

the one currently using has been dropped number of times is currently wrapped with scotch tape wanted new one in the event the older one gives up quits on me and with this newer sleeker one it has splace for the usb connector to be stored for travel purposes on the underside of the mouse another great feature think ,5

the sound quality is pretty good could not turn up volume past about halfway without getting distortion and bass was bottoming battery is great too much mid range little large and heavy no handles or convenient way to carry like the sound of my old bose mini sound link slightly better but will not get as loud of course ,5
the support team was extremely helpful had problem with the usb connection and we got new keyboard since all other methods to make it work again we re not working therefore they gave us new keyboard and the fact that they were just so friendly understanding and helpful not to mention how fast they are is fantastic thank you ,1
these headphones are nice to look at but the microphone sucks most gamers of any level or even someone who needs to use it for zoom conferences needs decent quality mic this is not that the positive reviews must only be focused on the sound and the look just got these couple hours ago and will be returning smh,1
this keyboard is nice and works perfectly the only thing don like about it is that you don have the option to keep the lighting on especially at night or playing games end up fiddling around finding out where am on the keyboard will keep it for backup but think will be looking for something with more lighting options ,1
this keyboard was great and effective at first ve had it for about months before it started having connectivity issues the keyboard is not communicating anymore and the keystrokes are not showing up on my screen the window to return this item closed months ago so stuck with this keyboard that will be recycling be wary of this product ,5
this mouse did not work from the get go which is why am certain was not it first owner this mouse was missing the one part it needed to operate usb receiver which is customarily located securely under the unit itself the mouse was halfway in sleeve as if re stuffed back into it original packaging returning this immediately,1

this mouse has the quietest click of any mouse ve ever owned and it puts itself to sleep if don move it for while it magical wasn sure about the color changing light but it not overpowering or distracting ve had very long line of previous wireless mice but think this is my favorite very pleased with this purchase ,1

this speaker is great the sound is so crystal clear we were in disbelief the first time we used it we love taking it to the beach and my fiance always takes it golfing with his friends the only thing would change is to make it lighter it is somewhat heavy and bulky wish it was thinner and lighter ,5
this was disappointing and irritating order am college student and full time manager so work lot on my laptop ordered mouse for ease of certain tasks that required right click or highlights this mouse was unusable directly out of the box charged it up and it never held charge long enough to work very disappointing and waste of time ,1
we liked this headphones the fact that they light up look amazing the only problem is that the cable that lights it up is very short so you have to be close to the console in order to connect the light it very uncomfortable cuz if you move it unpluggs other than that my son likes it very much ,5
wowwww not only did get this in four hours its fabulous highly recommend this based on other reviews took my chances update thought it was junk had it plugged into one of those usb strips bad idea they couldn keep the charge got usb plug and into the wall socket started charging super fast cancelled my return love this ,5
all around the product is bad bought it as christmas gift and the user can not speak to other people he can hear them fine the mic is turned on the settings on the console allow for chatting and he even reset the console to factory default beware of the cheap price tag as this is cheap product ,5
always loved these speakers and always will this one you re paying for more vocals than bass still maginifico only problem was my connectivity issues when first got this speaker could walk through my house with no problems now months later cant go steps literally out of range from the speaker without it skipping overall still great speaker,5
bought it after going through many water proof keyboards am clumsy so this got wet but after letting it dry completely it works again with no issues had some issues with the st one bought cause it would no longer sync with pc but talked with tech support they sent another and it has not had any issues ,1
bought this item and worked only for few weeks wanted to return it but wasn able to do so in the time frame because got hit with covid was too sick to return this item and wish we could get our money back because the item doesn even work worked for few weeks and no longer will charge ,1
bought this mouse as the color and led were quite cool would expect it to work like normal mouse but when clicking one has to click quite hard for it to work moreover there is lag when moving the cursor while using the mouse thought it was battery issue but even after charging it the same thing happened ,5
charge is perfect someone says the issues about the mono speaker but think it has higher quality than last generation cause two speakers are two close that the stereo cannot show in accurate steps so think it good idea to buy it by the way from the usa to korea only takes days the ships are so great ,1
do not use this keyboard if you are programmer and need the backslash key often typically this key is to the right of the close bracket key instead its row lower this requires you majorly change how you code you can even remap the key to something else simply because theres no other key to remap it to ,5
ergonomically find it to be too short and bit uncomfortable bought it as travel mouse so could over look that except that it barely works every time have tried to use it it eventually gets super laggy and almost impossible to use turning it off and on again fixes it but only until it starts to lag again ,1

good portable speaker the only thing and imagine it happens to all portables the load is directly proportional to the level of volume you use if you use it low average lasts three days or more if you use it at full power three or four hours at most in general good sound and meets what is offered ,1
got this because figured have better luck with connectivity while playing call of duty on the ps yet can be standing close to box and barely hear the sound of it let alone enemy footsteps yes have the sound at in the game settings and the volume dial turned all the way up sending it back for refund ,1
great keyboard feels and looks good and comes with nice little note quiet and little small about inches by inches but connects quickly and holds good charge too customer service is outstanding very happy with their warranty policy and they gave me brand new keyboard when mine stopped working if you need gaming keyboard this is the one ,1
great spearker for the size of this speaker it really puts out great sound the battery life is pretty good but that depends on the volume you have it at haven tested the water proof abillity yet and hope don have to but have seen videos about it overall highly recommend this speaker it is really nice buy ,1
harmon kardon has better bass fursure and quality is better the only cool thing about jbl is the water proof im never gunna be in the water soo they got me on that just get harmon kardon onyx round bt speaker trust me on that one plus its big with not enuff bass like mon man foreal smh ,5
i always loved jbl products they have amazing sound quality for their price point when ordered it was nervous cause always like to test speakers out in store before ordering it but could this time it was gift for my partner and was definitely not disappointed the speaker isn to big and it definitely sounds amazing definitely recommend ,5
i gave it two stars because like glowing lights can you tell child of the if could give it zero stars for function would this mouse has lot of good reviews maybe mine is fluke it is however fairly horrible the charge on the battery is extraordinarily short lived and when charged it sort of sucks then too ,1

i have been having problems with my current headphones so bought these on the recommendation of another gamer and so far they have been amazing quick easy setup and then it was straight to using them have connected them to my pc my ps and have used them for just music great and clear sound across the board ,5
i have held back writing review on this mouse based on some of the comments that it would die on them or it became unreliable after while it has not been the case for me have had it for several months now and it is very reliable and maintains all of its functions intact would recommend the mouse ,1

i have purchased two of this product in the past year one to replace the other on both of the the scroll button stopped working dropped the first one and understood why it stopped working the second one did not drop it just quit working after months cute and light weight but not long lasting enough for me ,1

i liked this mouse just fine bought it to use at school with my chromebook it was fine until couple weeks ago scrolled the mouse wheel and something broke now the wheel just spins and spins and does nothing only used it few times week for meetings and such would buy better one don bother with this one ,5
i listen to music none stop all day everyday ve bought tons of different bluetooth speakers jbl is the best by far some would say they are over priced but if you can get that same sound quality and battery life plus durability out of something cheaper what the point your just robbing yourself get the good stuff,1
i love the clicky ness love the backlit lights but extremely upset that got keyboard usb plugin for bluetooth yet no cord to charge the keyboard came with it there weren any instructions just keyboard and plugin may have to return it so can set the time out setting on the lights very frustrating and waste of time ,1
i love this mouse use it on multiple devices and it uploads fast like it how sleep mode would kick in if you haven used it in while however it is easy to wake up as well like it how you can switch between solid red to rainbow colors its quite and moves smoothly did mention love it ,5

i ve had mine for years now and the outer skin on the earmuffs is now peeling off they still sound great for how much they cost but told the mic doesn sound very good ve since switched to another mic but still use this headset and will continue to do so until the earmuffs completely fall apart ,1
i wrote negative review for this purchase company reached out to me and offered replacement free of charge while really appreciate the replacement found the new set of headphones had the same issue as the original choppy sound is not an ideal way to immerse yourself into game truly appreciate the company effort but can recommend this product ,5
its nice not having to buy batteries all the time for my mouse only downside is when don move the mouse for while you have to click the button to wake it up sometimes it clicks on the screen and clicks on something didn want to click on or open update it died months later not worth it ,5

love it have had many portable speakers knowing full well that portability would sacrifice sound quality not so with my jbl charge great sound so easy to connect works great in the yard and on my boat got great deal on it as well definitely would like to try out the connect feature when pick up another one ,5
mouse is comfortable to use silent clicks however failed after only months of use use every day for maybe couple of hours at time turned off when not in use and plugged in when necessary died about week ago after having for only months would not recharge will not use rechargeable mouse again would rather use rechargeable batteries ,5

not really worth it since the extra wires get in the way if your buying for xbox or playstation it terrible because not only do the lights not work but you need to plug the usb into your consol without plug for the usb it just gets extremely annoying to use the sound quality okay for the price ,5
not sure why but this keyboard worked fine for about months and then poof no more just wouldn connect to my windows pc at all before that would have given it stars as it had the return button in weird placement compared to standard keyboards and it did seem to need charging more frequently than would have liked ,5
really surprised with this headset my turtle beaches went out and bought these as cheap replacement tried it out today and it works above and beyond of what thought get for the mic is good and clear but what shined for me was the noise cancellation and base that had nice kick to it very happy with it ,5
recently bought the keyboard less then three days ago despite being fully charged it constantly turns off and stutters when try to use it for wow ll press the key to move forward and my character will take step stop for few seconds and take step while hold the key down do not waste your money on this ,1
solid speaker and sounds fantastic but doesn sound all that far off from the great sound of its predecessor only upgraded only because had thought the sound would be improved by considerable margin waterproof feature was also big reason why needed one as this sounds incredible in pool scenarios asides form that not upset that bought this speaker ,5
started out great but after about weeks and when the return window closed will not hold charge it charging when the blue light is on only stays on for second after plugging in if there were stars would give it that didn even have enough time to really use it only got about uses before it wouldn charge ,5
stopped working day and half after got it ve charged it and everything and it just won work good for the couple of hours that did use it thought the lights were pretty so give it two stars for having pretty lights but no other stars because it was waste of my money since it no longer works ,5

superb sound quality great dynamic range crisp highs and deep deep bass battery lasts for at least hours pairing is quick and stable app is simple and works fine can check charge level and play stereo or party mode with additional speakers seems durable and only hope it lasts buy and get ridiculously great mobile stereo for about ,5
the mouse started off okay it worked like it should for few weeks but then the battery would not make it through my work day the charge lasted less each time until suddenly it stopped holding charge like other reviews state it stopped working literally days after the return window closed ll be buying name brand mouse now ,1

the mouse was decent for the price however now just about weeks out of my return window and the scroll stopped working on the mouse days ago was hoping it was random temporary issue but it seems it permanent disappointed that can at least return or exchange the item and now have to go and buy new mouse ,1

the scroll button stopped working after months bought it in july and now only november it doesn work anymore it very unfortunate this happened would expect this will last the shape is good it easy to use and to connect but the item received unfortunately didn last will try to contact the seller and see what they say ,1
these headphones are amazing especially for the price the cable is long and the braids make it tough the headphones itself are pretty comfortable and the sound quality is really good also really like the fact that there is switch to mute the microphone and volume controls right on the cable great gaming headset at an affordable price ,5
this came with an charging attachment but why this uses normal cell phone charger port and all the intuitions are in chinese theres random button at the top and when press it nothing happens and dont know how to tell how much charge there is on it other than that really like it so far its very sleek ,5

this gaming headset is perfect there is no noise at all when tried it there was no noise but there actually was some noise around me the sound is so good you can control it so easy also you can mute and unmute your mic at anytime thie headphone is the best headphone for small and big gamers ,5
this headset is complete garbage the usb plug wouldn work only lights up the headset using the audio plug the sound is staticy and you can barely hear at full volume listening to music video to test the sound was chopping cutting out the artists voice all over the place worst headset have ever used opened return immediately ,5
this is large speaker read the dimensions but its significantly larger than the flip series my only criticism would be that it does not really have quiet setting even the lowest it can go is still sometimes little louder than wanted that being said it sounds great can be very loud and we haven had any issues yet ,1
this keyboard is ass dont buy it please so many typos from bad connectivity less than month in and it cant even hold charge now complete waste of money if we humor it not breaking so quickly the auto off feature of seconds of inactivity horrible and cant be disabled this is bad product in lot of ways,5
this keyboard is pretty cool but it doesn seem to hold up to my son gaming we had to return it for new one in the first month the second one seems to be working fine with no issues think it is not for serious gamers it will be fine at desk where it doesn get moved lot ,5
this keyboard looks fantastic especially with the breathing setting but the connectivitiy is garbage it makes gaming fristrating because the keybiard will lag you will put in an input and it will take few seconds to register if it registers at all there is also no indicator if it is about to die fully charged it still lags ,1
this mouse worked well for about months then it stopped holding charge even tethered to the laptop it was not working well but why buy wireless mouse if it needs to be used wired and why use wired mouse if it doesn even work don waste your money ll go pull out my ancient wired mouse that works ,1

this thing is durable beast much better bass than the jbl flip but it is also much larger not too large to not bring places but large enough that it isn quite as back pack portable as the flip if you are looking for mildly portable car camping speaker then look no further this charge is the bomb ,5
very comfy and sounds amazing wearing the headset it isnt too heavy or bulky and the sound quality is crazy good its like you are actually there it sounds so real its crazy would definitely buy again and recommend to others also really liked how there is headphone jack and usb to use to plug into your electronics ,5
was going back and forth trying to figure out which jbl speaker to purchase finally settled on the charge because all the jbl products are great and it has been the best purchase that have made the sound is great and it very loud speaker for its size would recommend to anybody in the market for travel speaker ,5
worked flawlessly for few days then the left button became unreliable not worth the hassle to return update seller emailed me saying that they had corrected the problem and offered refund if took down this review replied rather have corrected unit which would then review they replied they weren fixed yet and offered to my refund ignored it ,5

works well but the cord is very clunky these are stylish and easy to use but the cord is very thick and heavy which guess is good thing for durability but not necessarily for comfort do like the option of the volume control being on the cord but it is already so heavy enough that it is cumbersome ,5
you get what you pay for if you just need quick mouse on the go so you don need touch pad this is great enduring use of everyday mouse spend the money for one that is lightweight ventilated ergonomic or combination this one soft clicks decent feedback good battery just not super high quality for the desk job,1

you may be thinking that you are typing everything as expected later you will realize that kb stopped typing or missing some characters in the middle of your writing worst buy from amazon dear amazondo not allow to tarnish your reputation customer trust is the important factor for you right please help your customers do perfect quality test ,1
after doing ample research think jbl is the way to go for bluetooth speakers the sound quality is great battery life is long and it great addition to any beach trip or backyard bbq after reading lot of reviews settled on the charge bc it seemed to have the most positive feedback and least amount of glitches ,5
amazon had it in the wireless section and it not wireless in fact there are plenty of long wires to annoy you it sound quality is sound quality as well as not being confortable fit and pain to wear if on for more than minutes easy choice to return and get new one do not buy this ,5
at first really loved this mouse fast connection and worked well but like several other reviews mentioned after about months it just stopped working it didn charge or anything it just literally stopped working for that alone would rate it bad pedi to because it doesn last didn drop it or beak it it simply stopped working ,5

awesome speaker that plan on purchasing again for myself the one bought was for my girlfriend but hours battery life is straight up lie did mention the speaker sounds great with great bluetooth range and controls love this thing so much also my girlfriend probably doesn know the best practices of maintaining the longest battery life possible ,1
battery finally died for the first time after about weeks sets the bar pretty high resistance is perfect and not loudkeys are bright enough to be cool and visible but not blinding in the dark charges relatively fast and you can use it while charging first delivery didn show up but amazon worked it out with me ,1
edit the typing experience is very unpleasant particularly when using the ctrl or shfit key with another key this makes typing errors abundant and frustrating good quality and build the lighting is just adequate not too bright not too dim the year warranty is big plus still have to test battery life will update if anything changes ,1
first of all none of the cords work plugging it both into the playstation controller secondly in order to talk in here you can do it simultaneously you have to change it each time course this would be pain in the ass but it never works garbage returning it tomorrow want full refund in the premier brand,5
got mouse for my son the light look cool and it was comfortable no complaints until the trackball quit working after about days contacted the company they communicated well and replaced it very quickly about week later the same thing happened again great communication and no issues with refund so good communication but not the best mouse ,1

got this set for my son who has been using it for school work chatting with friends and gaming on his computer we have been very happy with the headset it has worked flawlessly with no issues whatsoever sound quality is great and the headset has served its various purposes very well so far would definitely recommend ,1
hopefully mine was the outlier because mine was bricked on arrival power button only lit up while plugged in and even then none of the buttons would function and the unit would not play music even when showing full battery have flip already which love and am highly disappointed had to get refund expected better from jbl,5
i am thrilled with the speaker use it to play podcasts mostly when exercising sound is excellent for spoken text and does good job with commercial pop rock etc it is not suitable for most art music classical does not handle the wide dynamic range of this type of music nor the subtle timbres of instrumental ensembles ,5
i bought these for my classroom have sixteen total they are constantly connecting to each others receivers and some just losing connection and not reconnecting after sleep mode think it good office mouse for anyone who isn using it in setting where lot of them are being used do not buy if you need more than one ,5

i travel lot wanted slim light mouse for work and school this mouse is perfect it fully charged in hours slim comfortable to use for hours when fully charged it can last for days also the changing light affect is pretty cool definitely recommend this mouse for someone who either works from home or is college student ,5
i used this mouse to play minecraft and not long after got it say month the mouse it started slowly malfunctioning this is disappointing considering there were so many good reviews now am in need of another mouse and wish could get my money back because not made of money and thought this would last me while ,5
i want to really like this speaker but overall it good quality sound not very loud good bass looks good my biggest complaint is the battery can run this speaker for more than minutes unplugged from the wall before the sound is getting chopped as if it about to die really disappointed considering this speaker wasn cheap ,5
it good keyboard with caveats in order of personal importance the key layout is different from the typical keyboards ve used in the past years the backlighting is dim at its brightest and goes out quickly maybe there way to make it persist till some timeout period the keys are tad squishy but otherwise they feel okay,5
it got delivered month ago and it has stopped working after using for like the th time it turns on them off immediately it got charge and just won work glad got my invoice since can still write it off as business expense not good product and will not buy again not very pleased with this device ,1

keyboard is great functions as promised the follow up email was truly helpful as many of us do not read the instructions the key instructions were in the email and made the keyboard even more functional one improvement that feel would be nice being able to change the color of the lighting mainly to all one color ,5
looks like the track wheel is connected to an internal device using very fragile thin piece of plastic was simply using the mouse didn drop it or slam it and suddenly the tactile feedback of using the track wheel stopped and the mouse would no longer scroll the screen too bad actually liked the mouse until then ,1

my life has changed the sound quality of this battery is perfect for my space look we would all like perfect sound quality but the truth is so many factors determine sound quality especially the recording itself the jbl offers greatvpower turning down the volume usually helps with balancing the sound when played at higher levels winner ,5
my son really likes this headset and it worked well for the first months bought it for him for christmas and it no longer works properly by the end of feb unfortunately he can no longer talk with his friends while playing because the mouthpiece quit working he can still hear everything but they can hear him ,5
not going to lie not particularly impressed with this keyboard the reaction time is not all that great but what is really annoying is that there is no warning when the battery is low so you can be playing game and suddenly it stops working also no way that have found to tell how charged it is,1
now don really use my headset to talk to people in game so let me preface this review by saying have no idea how that works but it perfect for what need it for which is to have headphones in while game the sound quality is absolutely beautiful and it goes perfect with my purple ps controller,5
omg where do start love love love this speaker use mine all the time as hook up my spotify playlist to this kickin speaker and blast the tunes around my house the sound is perfect the shape is perfect using it is breeze and transports easily into the shower yes waterproof too did mention love this speaker ,1
only the mic worked it did not pay any audio or music and the mic sounded extremely staticky would not recommend they finally got back to me and are sending me new one so will increase the stars because of their customer service if the next one doesn work then ll go back down to lower store,5
overall this keyboard is good connects fine lighting is pretty cool keys are comfortable very very light and doesn take up too much space on the desk however it doesn remain charged at all even after left plugged in overnight the keyboard dies after being unplugged it still works okay but the battery life is extremely disappointing ,5
pro excellent backlighting lock keys indicators that are not usually seen on other wireless keyboards including logitech and microsoft the keyboard has great crisp positive feel there is no battery to replace it is perfectly sized for under desk trays con not sure if there is battery low indicator as the battery did run down too expensive ,5
recently purchased this mouse the look of the lights is cool not fan of the sleep mode but did love the smooth feel of movement and the track wheel was perfect however after day and half went to charge it and it never came back on thought it needed to charge longer but no just stopped working ,5

the keyboard feels good when typing it accurate the backlight is good touch is good touch and allows for typing in dark places the size is good my only complain is that the keyboard is not silent at all even though it advertises being so unless you do words per minute then you won be typing silently ,5
the keyboard feels great looks great but it not nearly special enough for how often it needs to be plugged in it has died on me in the worst situations never any sort of warning and happens roughly once every weeks would much rather have hardwired or battery operated keyboard than this battery life is frankly unacceptable,5
the sound is really impressive on this headset and like the sturdy mic rather than bendy one you can really complain for the price but the mic is mid it isn like razer mic duh but it picks up your voice just find with minimal background noise it comparable to my logitech webcam mic hope this helps ,5
the sound quality both playback and recording is fine however find the earmuff portion of the headset to be bit too small as it does not fit around my entire ear and don have particularly large ears afaik this probably wouldn be huge issue for most people but if you have earrings it might be bit uncomfortable ,1
the sound quality is on par maybe slightly better than other units in this price point easy to wear not heavy at all the noise canceling is not the best but was not expecting anything crazy good works well for the kids when gaming the lights give it that wow factor for the kids no issues here ,5
these are ok when bought these thought it would be perfect to tune out outer noise it doesnt its good to hear for music if you play it others that are in your surroundings can hear just as much as you can phone calls can be heard thru these headphones might send back but really dont like,5
this headset is perfect for ps its also pretty good for xbox but dont like how you have to plug in the extra cord and its very short give it only for the short cord but other than that it is perfect comfortable and overall good looking also like how it was packaged so neat and safely ,5
this is good rechargeable keyboard that holds charge for long time you can still use the keyboard when it is plugged into usb port for charging placement of keys is taking some getting used to in particular the enter key as touch typist find myself hitting wrong keys when should be connecting with the enter key frustrating,5
this is the second time have ordered this mouse actually really like the mouse except for the fact that they keep breaking and have to order new one so for that reason am only going to give you two stars ordered this particular mouse only two months ago and it already broken should get my money back ,1

wanted to like this since it was cheaper for wireless keyboard with backlighting with in month or of normal use the letters and numbers wore off that could live with but then the one of the shift keys broke in half and made this unusable again this was with normal office use no gaming no smashing keys ,1
way better than expected but still amazing speaker can change my phone don turn the vol to the max because want life of the speaker we go camping lot so far it lasted good hrs of nonstop music play vol medium high and did good along with charge two iphones xr and xs can complain at all ,5
well thought the product was great but expected it to be louder which it wasn don get me wrong it is pretty loud but just expected it to be more to the reviews ve seen they made it seem like you would physically have to lower the volume or else you would go deaf but don know ,5
when ordered my keyboard for my boyfriend the charging piece wasn in the box so messaged customer service and they sent me new one within couple days once used the keyboard it was nice quality the keys were smooth and satisfying to press it connected very easily to the pc definitely if you want keyboard buy this,1
work really well for normal use with gaming actually sound about as good as other headphones have with sound canceling turned off the mic is actually really good and clear long cord not very many complaints except maybe the ear pads might be tad but more comfortable but what you pay for them is really good price ,5
you get what you paid for this headset probably is good for gaming but bought it to use for my work video conferences and people complain about the quality of my voice over microsoft teams will need to get higher quality headset edit the seller contacted me with an offer of gift card if remove my review ,1
bought these as christmas gift for my boyfriend mind you he tends to have expensive taste when it comes to technology after putting them on he scolded me because he figured they must ve costed one to two hundred dollars lol thanks amazon great clarity of sound and noise cancellation months later they still work great ,1
decent sound quality directional sound works well mic is little quiet but you can easily fix this in settings on the windows pc am using so no problems there the usb seems miscellaneous unless you want them to light up which is kinda cool honestly lol but would be nice if the usb extension was removeable,5
good speakers for standard sq feet in room or space don have to charge it often ll say ill still be fine almost up to days because ll only use it for hours wish it came with strap to hold it or speaker case at least for travel worthy small speaker with good sound and base ,1
great little mouse precisely what was looking for except that it only lasted months ve had it just that long and the scroll wheel is now disconnected and doesn work anymore the mouse is still functional otherwise but use the scroll wheel constantly for work so will just keep it as backup and find something else ,5
i actually love this speaker it easy to clean off the sand if you take it to the beach lake you can listen to it for hours just have had it on for over hours now as listening through the night charges fast the sound is amazing perfect to set the mood or party it out ,5
i am really happy with the purchase of this mouse had been looking for good mouse that cheap and wireless this is the best fit am able to carry this everywhere and has long lasting battery also the range of the bluetooth is really good because was able to control my computer while was another room,5

i don write reviews very often but will make an exception for this piece of junk were you wanting wireless keyboard because this is not wireless it requires usb cable for power oh yes indeedy and so now you are using not one but two of your usb ports for this bs what waste of time,1
i got the vifa reykjavik and although would say at the mid level the sound quality is identical clear bold and good bass this jbl blows the competition out of the park at the higher volume settings no distortion or loss in quality the speaker is built well and looks great too worth the money think ,5
i got this in june and it now the end of september it was great at first and lasted multiple days on charge but now the battery dies after just couple of hours and it dies randomly without any warning so it always in the middle of using it frustrating this lasted maybe months in total,1

i like this headset really do after about an hour of wearing the headset it starts to hurt my ears little bit not that the volume is too loud but maybe because have big head and big ears for the price the quality is great the seller did everything as promised and shipping was on point ,5

i use this to game with am by no means an extreme or hard core gamer it works just fine for me to sit on my couch and play the witcher the light feature is nice if you want one you can customize look elseware this is budget keyboard and works well for what it is ,5
i was pretty happy with this keyboard bit louder than wanted but good just couple weeks ago maybe months after purchase the keyboard cannot send typing commands to any computers it can turn on light up etc have tired multiple cables direct connection or rf usb connection etc nothing works would suggest spending your money elsewhere ,5
i was surprised about the great sound it connected almost by itself with my computer it makes my computer sound system sort of portable disappointed that the receiver sound stops as soon as connect the jbl computer cannot send bluetooth signal and hard wired signal to the receiver at the same time maybe need new computer ,5
if you re looking for wireless mouse keep looking this is not it the first one received didn charge so they sent me another one which started using at the beginning of july and now it doesn work anymore didn even last months with normal usage no gaming or anything such shame because actually liked it ,1

just received replacement mouse as the first one stopped working after few months really like this mouse it glides smoothly and without time delay used this strictly for basic internet and office work not gaming it also visually attractive with changing color lights this has great year warranty which covers defects problems very pleased so far ,5
my daughter has one of these and when heard it was blown away awesome sound with deep bass it sounds best up to about of volume but even that is more than plenty of volume the battery is awesome lasting several days and you can charge your phone or ipad without reducing lot of battery life ,5
pretty easy to use and set up comes with charger expected the lights to be bit more appealing but they re mainly just solid colors when you have it on the led light mode fits snug with my hands and does the job for the most part so complain probably wouldn use for gaming purposes though ,5

really happy with the purchase considering the money paid the sound has been crystal clear remember this is not usd headphone so lets not consider this with bose or sony products also it comes with the required accessories so you can use this with the desktop the build is really good and it holds very good ,5
received as gift and wanted to love it but the hot keys issue is real the ctrl and shift keys on the left side cannot be used together as programmer can live without hot keys like this select text to end or beginning of documents uppercase or lowercase words etc many editors use these hot keys ,5
received for christmas in december and it stopped working in the beginning of february while it was playing music it stopped and has not turned back on since despite being charged over night and it being month later of trying everything to make it work again no lights or sign of life strongly would not recommend ,5
so far so good was suppose to be christmas present for my son however it came boxed with lb bag of dog food and keyboard box was smashed also the seal was cut open so had to have my son make sure everything worked not much of present surprise but at least it works so far ,1
the bengoo stereo gaming headset has an outstanding mic and the noise cancellation helps lot ve just got it today and tested it out the sound is amazing and the microphone is outstanding as well had many of my friends confirm the sound of my microphone and the led lights make it look cooler really recommended ,1
the color is spot on it is ergonomic and more flat than arched sometimes think it is too wide but yet it not the price was right the color choices were great overall happy that found this mouse it was for my apple laptop as it didn have one and hated not having mouse to navigate,5

the idea of this mouse sounded nice and fun however was very disappointed to see that the usb is slightly bigger than other usb cables and it did not fit into my laptop or any other usb port for that matter perhaps this one was defective but this was unacceptable would give zero stars if could ,5

the mic is too soft and my friends say sound muffled all the time its worse than the mic previously had and wish could get refund but don know have the time to do returns since am traveling around now messed with my sound settings to try and increase the volume but it didn change anything ,5
this headset was purchased as christmas present for my son he really loves it his friends ask him what headset he has because they can hear him perfectly must have good sound quality because he can never hear me when try to talk to him great product for the price glad we went with this one ,5
this is by far my favorite mouse can wake up my computer by tapping the button on the mouse goes to sleep saving me bit in new batteries if didn notice the mouse sliding off the laptop and onto the chair laser up would be changing the batteries frequently this one recharges no batteries to buy ,5

this is good head set if you need something quick and cheap for gaming have kids ranging from to and if the younger ones get ahold of them don expect them to last very long they are cheap enough that just get new pair when they stop working they work well but are no bose headset ,1
this is great wireless keyboard and it really quiet which sure over time and use the loud clicking will return that what my other gaming keyboard did anyway it feels comfortable it works great and enjoying it so far just wish the keyboard itself was little bigger but that my fault for not checking the measurements ,5
this is the rd pair second through this account have bought and all three still work great my and year olds use these so you can just imagine the wear and tear they receive on daily basis and they work great little bulky on my youngest kiddo but it works as intended and has been durable ,5
this is very very nice sturdy headset especially for the great price have previously owned headsets that were at least triple the price and still think these are better not only are they comfortable they are perfect for gaming which is what purchased them for will definitely be purchasing items from this company from now on ,5
this mouse is cute and convenient not heavy the shiny black color looks nice against the colors and it is quiet works fine with my macbook air the only thing is that the usb adaptor it comes with is very hard to insert it into the port that it comes but besides that everything works fine ,5

this mouse is terrible bought it for work its not like needed anything super advanced just something that would give me little more space than the touchpad this mouse skips when you move it and if you want to click something you have to hit the button or times it also very uncomfortable in the hand ,5

this mouse worked perfectly for about months almost on the month mark exactly the scroll wheel stopped working it just spins and doesn move the cursor up and down the page looked to see if could return but the window closed month ago don be tempted by the cheap price should have stuck to name brand ,1

this speaker was great while it still worked kept it primarily in the same spot used it maybe minutes day was never rough with it and one day it just died on me doesn charge doesn power on ve owned bluetooth speakers that lasted me years and still work but this was complete waste of money ,5
very nice product received it in two days as promised with prime only needed to charge it initially for about an hour my samsung phone paired with the speaker in about seconds the sound is great and this is just what was looking for to provide music while work on projects in the basement and garage ,5
worst wireless mouse have ever purchased the lag time to respond to movement is horrble clicking is even worse sometimes have to click three or four times before the mouse works tried on multiple systems just to be sure it was not an issue with one laptop do not purchase complete waste of money and time ,5
 if you have big hands don recommend you buying this also with the lighting really dislike it if you look at the video it goes through the mouse and you can see all the the stuff inside very disappointed overall it good and sturdy mouse just thought they could ve worked on the exterior more ,5

after using this as an everyday keyboard for six months now there are few problems with even with full charge the keyboard will randomly power off have missed keystrokes and there no way to tell how much charge is left in the battery it is quiet however but wouldn use it as an everyday keyboard ,5
bought this to replace my destroyed jbl flip sound quality is awful compared to the flip also the flip had lanyard attachment to hang it which you can with the charge and the charge function takes hours to charge my samsung overall save your money and get the flip its less expensive louder better quality,5
broke after no more than minutes of use something on the inside disconnected and the scrawling wheel spins freely not only it was waste of money actually needed compact mouse for my portable office forgot all about it in my trip now it is too late to return it you get what you pay for ,5

easy to pair and stays charged for hours bought it for gardening the back deck and beach trips some other reviewers are disappointed in sound quality but for the price it really great deal have no complaints about the sound wasn expecting sound for listen to wide variety of genres and can fault this speaker ,5
everything is good but the keys would look better with light color light it means on the left side blue purple mixes up with black color of the keyboard makes the contrast less appealing it works great on the right side though with green light blue there is no yellow though that would be better ,5
good lighting on the keys for typing in low lighting comfortable typing perfect keyboard size not huge but not tiny either wish there was way to but batteries in it in case the internal rechargeable battery ever goes out it does come with cable for charging overall very good keyboard happy with it so far ,5
great mouse for the price nice and soft matte feel very quite clicks perfect for working in coffee shop works well on mouse pads and flat surfaces and connected to my computer instantly without needing to instal any type of software note rgb lights are not customizable but still cute as heck and works great ,1

great price for what you get not upset with the product at all the headphones are not good for what wanted which is high quality sound mic ended up going with the corsair hshaptics and am thoroughly impressed as said general gaming for kids great product higher end gaming streaming for avid gamers spend elsewhere ,5
headphones are great with amazing sound quality decent noise cancellation and would say it good for gaming did realize when it at full volume you can hear it from distance and sadly the lights don rly work bc the wire that makes the light turn on doesn reach when also try to use the headphones ,1
hi and use this for gaming and distance learning it great can really get into my games when gaming because the sound quality is great and really enjoy feeling like in the game it isn quite noise canceling because can still hear bit when have the headphones on my head overall happy with my purchase ,5
i bought of this product for myself and my family all stopped scrolling just like that when my first one went bad borrowed my daughter and that stopped scrolling so did the other and we only had them for little over month when they stopped working there appears to be major defect in this product ,1

i got this one to upgrade from my flip really really like it the battery lasts longer has great quality sound do notice that the speaker is clearly heard from whichever direction the front of the speaker is facing it also has fair distance in which the music can be heard even at lower volume ,5
i have always wanted the charge after purchasing the flip now that have it love the sound can connect it with the other flip in party mode and it great can also connect thru bluetooth my laptop audio which is great for zoom meeting and streaming it great product and don feel it will disappoint ,5

i have smaller jbl speaker and really enjoy it so decided to get the jbl charge as an upgrade this speaker was surprisingly disappointing the bluetooth function was terrible couldn get consistent listening experience it would cut out despite updating firmware switching wi fi networks forgetting and reconnecting the bluetooth ended up returning the product ,5
i have to like speak louder for it pick up on my voice or move my mouth closer to the mic it kind of annoying other then that it cool mic and it looks nice the sound quality is pretty good not bad but if ur more quieter person like me it not for u,5
i like this headset lot more than the red and blue headset the microphone quality has some issues using it on discord and can be little tricky to gauge the sensitivity but the sound is pretty good it is crisp for the most part love to use these headphones because they re also very comfortable ,5
i like this keyboard it does everything want it to do and like the color scheme don think that changeable but could be wrong the only real problem ve had with the keyboard is that it will turn off with no warning that it low on battery it also has good feel to the buttons ,1
i loved this mouse when first got it it moves nicely and the colors around the base is awesome could tell it was cheaply made but didn think more of it just went to use it now and the scroller in the middle is busted it rotates but it doesn do anything on my computer ,5

i purchase this mouse for my kid he had an old one using batteries only he is frustrated by replacing batteries so frequently every weeks like the feature including rechargeable and charge when you use it it really creates big convenience for children now he can stop looking for the new batteries around the house ,5
i purchased this as gift for my teenage grandson he loves it the sound is great he can connect via bluetooth he has it connected to his playstation and sings in the shower with it my daughter happy too because now that he has his own he leaves hers alone great gift for them both ,5
i really was disappointed in this product just needed an extra mouse for work andnit only worked for few hours before the problems started it wouldn track where the mouse was and the lights worked but the mouse was useless other than the light show save your time and choose mouse from more reputable company,1

it is nice mouse and liked that it came with an adapter for the macbook however the adapter did not work which made the mouse unusable the adapter seems flimsy and cheap luckily had an adapter and the mouse now works fine if you are buying this for mac would recommend investing in good adapter ,5

just arrived and my son was so excited we plug it into the sony ps controller not off brand and nobody can hear him chat in fortnight my husband plugged it into his phone and the microphone worked why not the ps that what we bought it for so it basically useless for our needs ,5
lightweight nice looking wireless fair price but it stopped working after less than year really liked this keyboard but dealing with keyboard that is outputting constant characters to the computer and can imagine how to fix it if turn this on it locks up my computer and tries typing numbers and odd ascii characters shame ,1

my son whom move with my whole heart runs through headsets like they grow on trees unsure how or why it happens but several sets have been laid to rest it been about month and these still look brand new would recommend you by them if your child is serial headphone killer like mine is ,1
my year old autistic son loves these headphones and tried them out as well just to make sure he wasn just saying he likes them just to appease me they re comfortable and not too loud even on the nintendo switch can still hear outside moises but it does not make me regret these headphones ,5
nice wireless keyboard bought to replace logitech wireless kb that got banged around for the last couple of years the only minor gripe is wish there was bit more margin around the edge often hit key accidentally when picking it up it is light weight wise and the lighted keypad is great for dark rooms ,1
overall really liked the mouse enjoyed the colors and the feel of it was very nice the main problem had is that specifically bought it for work for my mac laptop the adapter didn work at all had to keep holding it down at specific angle in order to use it at all very disappointing ,5

so bought it because it was on sale for dollars that should have been my first hint the sound quality was terrible ve had better call quality on ham radio from the freinds said it echoed and had static sound and there is about football feild length of wire hanging on it that just irritating ,1
so far so good although my first impression is that putting the on off switch underneath is stupid lights going off after minute is problematic in the dark unless you really know your touch typing fn pause lights high low or offif reviews are accurate now ll wait to see if got one that lasts ,1
some stuff is okay to cheap out on but wouldn recommend it with this keyboard it worked just fine until it completely stopped holding charge after only months of use if you really want sweet light up key board bite the bullet and spend the money for legit one don waste your time or money ,5
sounds great but the only reason bought it was because of the advertised battery life of hours it lasts hours charged out of the box for the whole night took it to work and turned on at am it played music until pm when it died very disappointed am returning it for my money back ,5
the click isn loud but it does get picked up by my gaming computer recorder the battery doesn last near long enough not even whole day even when you don have the lights on it does feel nice in the hand it does track well but would say mouse pad isn optional with this one ,5

the keyboard looked okay at first was little sad that the rgb was not dynamic but thought could live with that then realized there was major flaw when trying to do anything with it there is literally no key on the keyboard couldn even type this review on this keyboard or type the word keyboard ,5
the mouse is aesthetically very cute and does feel nice on the hand main issue is for both gaming and other computer activities the mouse will randomly jump across the screen which has never happened with any other mouse it led to misclicks ve deleted emails didn mean to because of it essentially just unreliable ,1

the sound quality and bass is better than any bluetooth speaker have purchased before have had zero problems long battery life is key for bluetooth speaker it says hours on the box but felt like it went longer before finally had to charge glad spent little more for better quality speaker this was worth it ,5
the speed at which it turns on and connects to your device is unmatched for me the battery life is just amazing have it playing for hours sometimes and it doesn even lose half the battery ve taken it out on the water and it gotten wet with no issues just an absolutely amazing speaker ,5
they were decently sounding with good amount of noise cancellation however these were more intended for pc because there is two cords one for sound and one for the lights the cord is too short to connect it to the ps also the cord is big and gets in the way too much while gaming ,5
this keyboard has short battery life and doesn give any sort of indication that the battery is low till it stops working then when you charge it it doesn let you know when its done it also doesn seem to like any alt or windows key related shortcuts from the left side only the right,5
this keyboard is great it works exactly as advertised the keys are quiet the design is very fluid and the lights are cool charged it once when it came out of the box and have used it for hours doing work and playing games still haven had to recharge great product definitely worth the money ,5

usb receiver broke inside my son computer when he tried pulling it out the reason he tried pulling it out was because the mouse wasn responding this happened on the st time ever trying to pull it out he had to use tweezer to take out the broken piece now none of it is working ,5
was deciding between this and ue boom went with the boom first and it just didnt have that deep bass and sound personally like but this charge does night and day on that battery im not sure yet haven ran it more than hrs at time but so far no issues glad got this one,5
was great mouse until it stopped working which was less than months after purchased it it was used and charged as per instructions then it suddenly stopped functioning all together would not purchase again because even with its low cost it not worth it to only get months use out of it do not recommend ,1

 after reading few reviews decided to give this headset try when put it on immediately felt the comfort the were talking about the quality that you get for the price makes it very much worthy it isn name brand headset you find at game stop but it is comparable maybe better stars hands down ,5
 not sure what happened but went to go use my computer and this is what see don have food or drink by this computer nor does anyone else use it had this keyboard for little over years looks like something expanded inside it and burst the seem of the keyboard some keys don work ,1
 year update just wanted to chime in again and let everyone know couldn be happier with this keyboard and the company you wont find better bang for the buck on this website highly recommendedvery comfortable keyboard smooth keys with good curve on the top charges with usb type single charge lasts for around week,1
both sounds and bass are great quality was outside the other day listening to music from my phone and had neighbor come by from houses down opposite side of the street asking me to turn it up laughed and said it was already on the highest volume impressed with how far the sound carried ,1
bought it in march and now the roller thing does not work mouse was never dropped opened and found that the attachment of the roller is broken it works as intended and love that it is rechargeable ll buy another one if it lasts long enough then maybe the first one is just fluke ,1

bought it on black friday the sound is little bit blurry that might be due to waterproof function sound format only supports sbc which is the most disappointed thing overall would rank it above average considering the promotional price on black friday and suitable for those who like bring their speaker for outdoor activities ,1
bought this for my granddaughter for christmas in nov she has been using it for less than days and it has critical issues with defective on off function contacted the jbl help line and tried all the reset options they offered but they did not work will try to get warrantee replacement from jbl ,5
didn realize that there wasn place to put battery in so it always had to be charged after two or three weeks could no longer charge it and could not have it work cheaply made would not recommend if you need it long term or if you spend lot of time on the computer,1

ergonomically it nice little clickier than expected the lights aren as bright as expected and the charge seems to be not very long had it unplugged for about an hour and not constantly typing and just had to plug it in as it seemed to be not registering keystrokes feel paid way too much,1
every since brought these for my son have to go to his bedroom about times day just to tell him he loud he loves them and so do sneak and play his game when he in school will be buying them again soon for myself and its my favorite color overnight shipping is plusssss,5
first removed the charging cable from the box and found that the wire was broken and figured could find another cable but then pulled out the mouse and it was broken as well the top half of the mouse was broken off from the bottom half needless to say returned the product for refund ,1
for its size it pounds out the music with surprising clairity and volume bass is astounding for its size perfect size for on the go with bikes side by sides camping and not to mention water use on the boat or beach with being water resistant solid science behind this unit worth every penny ,5
for the price this mouse is quite good top of the mouse is soft touch material it is comfortable to use not too big or small also like color of the light that always changes while am using the mouse am using this mouse for months my daughter have not broken it yet lol ,5

headset works great ear muffs are deep and large enough that they cover my ears fully with no pressure points normally when wear headset my ears start to hurt after min or so not the case with this headset very comfortable to wear for long periods of time at the office or gaming sessions ,5
i bought these for my son to use when playing the game and he loves them they do cancel out the noise so sometimes he has one ear on and one ear off yeller so he can usually hear me with them on the mic is clear when he is talking during the game ,5
i bought this keyboard for my everyday use and like it the back lighting is cool but suddenly the print on the keys is smearing and rubbing off to be clear my nails are very long and my fingerpads have never actually touched the keys it is so odd that the print is smearing ,5
i bought this keyboard for work wanted something quiet but also had rgb even tho there is only the basic rainbow and it not very bright for the price this keyboard is well worth it it very light for easy travel and the keys also feel surprisingly nice to type on for long periods ,5
i bought this specifically for pool party it loud waterproof not obnoxiously big and can still fit in bag loving my aqua color wasn home so my husband did an unboxing idk about everyone else but regardless if this only has internal speaker it jbl go for quality over quantity the sound is impeccable ,5
i don use this keyboard for game but type lot like it being very quiet when type and the led light is pretty when it on bought one of this keyboard couple months ago for work like it so much then bought another one for my home computer not expensive but good quality product ,5
i got of these for my kids to game with one on playstation and one on switch the sound and noise cancellation seems pretty good but the headsets won light up which is that they had wanted because the usb cord to make it light up isn long enough to plug into usb port ,5
i had gotten these headphones for my son for when he is on the playstation or his laptop and he enjoys it very much he has not found dislike to the headphones since getting them they came in quality condition and are excellent this product deserves stars because of how amazing these headphones are ,5
i have yet to be disappointed by bengoo products and this follow suit the sound is absolutelyphenomenal and these are comfortable the moment felt the head cushion when removing it from the packaging was shocked at how soft it was for very affordable gaming needs with high end quality you have to use bengoo ,5
i initially liked this mouse because it cute it too flat to be ergonomic but that was okay except ve used it for less than month and the scroll wheel has fallen off its track it also dies very fast and needs to be recharged often don recommend it for anyone using mouse regularly ,1

i just got it today and immediately paried my phone to it to listen to music and was very impressed with the bass sound and how clear the sound was it little bigger than my sister jbl flip and in my opinion think it packs bigger punch when it comes to sound and bass ,5
i like the sound quality lot and great bass my only complaint is the bulkiness of the headphones sadly you can change the color of the led lights you can only move the mic up and down and not side to side don feel the noise cancellation though its better than expected for headphones ,5
i love the quality and power that jbl delivers they never leave you hanging there it was delivered promptly the box was undamaged the packaging the speaker came in was pristine and the product itself was clean as ordered and has exceeded expectations would definitely buy this again or even the bigger better model ,5
i only have issues for this item the charging cord fell apart month after received it the mouse its self stopped working few months after receiving it after reaching out to the manufacturer who promised to replace the item which never received am forced to buy another mouse but definitely not from this manufacturer ,1
i purchased this mouse on march all of sudden the mouse just don want to move in the directions need it to each time move the mouse to different templates or screens it move then pause then move little and pause again would not recommend the mouse to anyone worst mouse ve ever purchased ,1

i purchased two different keyboards and after trying both this one won hands down it is so comfortable to use and stunning to look at use it for every day use and it perfect highly recommend it every time sit down to use my computer when hit that space bar smile it really cool ,5
i rarely ever give poor review on anything but am very disappointed in this product the internal battery will not take charge have tried other cables and charging boxes for the price paid for this we should expect that it last for years not months purchased the speaker on may and its now sept ,1
i ve had the mouse less than months and both the roller wheel and the piece that plugs into the usb port both broke managed to super glue the roller wheel back together but it just broke again buy slightly better mouse if you can not sure if all the reviews are even real ,1

it beautiful mouse with the color change but not happy that ve only had it few months and it no longer works at all don care for the usb adapter charging port because want to use old fashioned batteries sometimes to see if it would work but can because there is no battery slot ,1
it ergonomic and stylish very cute colors and cool lights comes with all the attachments like cords for charging and it has small indent under the mouse to keep the part that plugs into your laptop forever losing mine so that great feature very quiet as well recommend it for nice cheap little mouse ,1

it is ok for beginner headset or for your kid who plays and he probably gonna break it after couple weeks but other than that you pretty much get what you pay for it made out of cheap material and feels like it anyone who plays lot it probably not what your looking for ,5
it is too small for average size hand the mouse literally disappear in your hand used it for minutes and it was very uncomfortable my fingers do not rest on the buttons they go over it but the design and functionality is good you will enjoy using this mouse if you have small hands ,5
it really lives up to the silent clicking making it comfortable in way the batter also seems to last quite few days if you turn it off when it not in use it also has various light patterns when you click the button in the middle the silent clicking is what really gets me ,1

it worked fine for the first two weeks now it just stops playing music randomly doesn puase the music because the music on the phone is still going but you can hear anything have to press play on the speaker hasn been dropped or even exposed to any water even though its water proof ,5
it works fine however sometimes it does not response when you move your hand also do not recognize when the dpi is activated or not also when you click the bottom it does not response so you have to press it more than one time for it works also it is felt very plastic ,1

keyboard works okay except the key continues to get stuck as soon as started using it and needs to be picked at to lift it back into place and messes up my work lot the space bar is much louder than the rest of the keys which is more of an annoyance than anything ,1
love our new speaker but downsides it not as loud as we figured it would be good sound indoors but not nearly loud enough outdoors also sometimes it connects to phone first try but other times it takes much longer and is very hard to connect same with pairing it to another jbl speaker ,1
my child uses this for gaming he very happy with it he picky about headsets and this one seems to work well enough for him without any complaints he able to chat with others while gaming and sound quality is good for him easy to use and no setup required for gaming on pc ,1
my daughter needed wireless mouse for her laptop came across this one and bought it for it cool features size and price it is so smooth and she loves using it along with that fact that it lights up goes with her led lights in her room you won be disappointed with this mouse ,5

my fianc got me this as birthday gift and of course now just outside of the return window my mic doesn work so no one can hear me when we playing together and the headset doesn light up either very disappointed as now have headset that serves no purpose to me and can return ,1
my laptop has keys that don work so tried to reset it and sign back in the keys still didn work so ordered this key board and got it day later charged it by port cord which didn know was supplied plugged the usb in and didn need to install anything it just worked ,5
my old gaming headphones broke and quickly searched amazon for cheap pair for few bucks found these and saw they had great reviews so decided to give them shot didn have any expectations but these headphones blew them out of the water amazing sound quality and excellent noise cancellation features highly recommend these headphones ,5
my son loves his video games and with this headset he can play with his friends this is the second one he got and he wanted the same one because it is so comfortable it is really comfortable on the ears the voices are clear and he loves it we would highly recommend it ,5
portable and long battery life we ve used on float trips parties in garage fir the size it sounds good and base is good too sold my big speaker and stereo system in garage it plenty loud will be buying another one soon when they go back on sale bought mine in dec for ,5
pros sound quality is decent the in line volume control is convenient and they look really cool cons at least my particular headset had constant static noise even when use the mute switch on the volume control actually had to unplug the mic cable when was playing as to not annoy the other players ,5
purchased this keyboard for the office use back in may great keyboard quiet no delays battery lasted for about month at first then had to charge it every couple of weeks then every few days and now it died completely and cannot be used when plugged in very disappointed that it only last months ,5
sound is excellent don know really about the battery life yet has made it through two golf outings for total of hours of music without being recharged but doubt it will last much longer on one charge at volume not big fan of the base of the unit very small and rolls around easily,5
the back lights are not as bright as wanted them to be work in the dark really wanted to see it glow while was working the keyboard it self is perfect size for me the charging light never comes on but that is ok over all would buy another one for my home location,1
the battery made it two years but now it no longer holds charge and the charge has to be plugged in at all times to work battery can no be changed out only one year warranty and that doesn include battery issues previously had bose and they stand by their products including dead batteries ,5
the first mouse lasted months and bought the same mouse to replace it it died within day of using it buy cheap get cheap not worth trying to have it replaced so am sending it back for refund the first one worked great and had satisfying button click shame it didn last very long ,5

the mouse checks all my needs wireless low profile and inexpensive used to have roller ball mouse but found myself having to frequently clean the ball from lint and dirt so this is vast improvement ve used this for few days now and haven had to charge it yet so so far so solid ,1
these headphones are great for gaming with my friends like that the microphone folds up and it works perfectly with my ps would say that the passive noise cancellation is just due to the thick memory foam earmuffs which are nice but wanted to make it clear that they aren active noise cancellation headphones ,5
these headphones are really comfortable other headsets that ve purchased sometimes have hurt my head can wear these for hours and can even feel them on my head the battery is amazing and they charge really fast and stay charged for long period of time highly recommend these if you are looking for comfort ,5
this is great little mouse it is small responsive and love the way the light changes colors my hand is more relaxed when using it than with my previous mouse have had no issues with it so far overall based upon my experience thus far this was good purchase and would buy it again ,5

this is nice little keyboard was purchasing for typing not gaming the keys are quiet seemed to be responsive but just didn care for how short it was while using my wrist rest had to angle my hands downward to reach the keys if you don use wrist rest than would recommend this keyboard ,5

this one sound so good had to buy second one always outside grilling relaxing and this is perfect for my little carport set up carrie good bass but still doesn fall flat when you want to play some rock like queen or led zeppelin it so well rounded second one is for surround sound ,5
this product is amazing for consoles such as ps or xbox use the microphone for my ps and my friends love it they are trying to get their own pair for themselves right now really like the mic quality and the noise suspension there is barely any background noise recommend getting pair for yourself,5
this speaker arrived and it wasn even jbl it false advertising and would be tricked by purchasing it called amazon and they said there was nothing they can do avoid this item at all cost deployed overseas and received false product and there is nothing they can do completely disappointed by this be aware ,5
this thing is loud and sounds awesome had the jbl version of this and one day it just got really quite have only used the jbl once but love the sound and volume will probably use it over the stereo system in my boat which is pretty nice because this thing sounds so good ,5
works for what needed it to do but would be nice as work early in the mornings background lights could be al little brighter make it easier to see the keys the time out for sleep should be extended somewhat maybe little longer other than that does the job feels good to type on ,1
 don use the color changing feature so with that the battery life lasts really long time say that because purchased this may and my battery just now needs charged december and use this days week for work hours day love this product no noise sleek comfortable just love it worth it hands down ,5

 received this item as gift off my wedding registry check out my video for more detail but love this speaker the charge lasted me full week when was at the beach it super durable and wasn scared to get sand in it it goes super loud and super clear noise such great speaker ,5
 this is just below better than the spent on another headset do use the lights but enjoy the option mute button and control volume cancels out like surrounding noises which also enjoy because don like to be completely clueless to my surroundings comfy headset compared to the universal elastic ones other designs have,5
after few months the connecter is picky if it wants to work or not was great when it worked perfectly but with unplugging and plugging in it has gotten weak and no longer likes to work would recommend if you don have kids that like to play with your gaming set up lmao,5
box and packaging was great no physical damage to the head set but it doesn work took it out of the box to plug in and use and never even small noise was able to be heard smh they literally sold me broken product as if it was new and in perfect condition,5
good overall product for the money have had these headphones for one year now and they still work great the sound is good and the noise cancellation works pretty well they are mostly used with nintendo switch lite and they even work well with that happy with the product and would buy again ,5
got these for trip and was surprised at the build as well as the sound quality with the price of them the build could feel little better the ear cups creating better seal and the mic location or if it could move more inward other than that they sound great and feel comfortable ,5
honestly all the hate for this headset is uncalled for this headset has all you need at such good price fits perfectly and has long cord and the sound quality is amazing wouldn be where at gaming wise if it weren for these headsets allowing me to hear almost everything on the maps,5
i bought this first time and after few months it died completely even after being charged it will not respond when turned back on thought it might just be one time defect and bought another this time it died completely after month nice while it worked but will not be buying rd time ,5

i bought this for my son and the microphone didn work what disappointment update the headset works good initially gave it star thinking it didn work we just found out it was my sons controller with the problem luckily we kept the headset and tried it on new controller and it works great ,5
i bought this item few weeks ago and it was disappointing to find out the battery does not even last min at full volume but the worst part is that even if plugged to the charger the battery will die if speaker is in use which will cause for it to shut off ,5
i had an older smaller jbl and the battery stopped holding charge upgraded it to this larger unit the sound is great and the larger battery lasts long time it will run out faster if you are also charging your phone while using it but that fair tradeoff the bluetooth connectivity is flawless ,5
i have loved their products mainly the gaming headset they are perdectly listenable and can play without getting tired also its wireless mouse is better than ever its design is perfect and it can be seen at night with its lights and everything is perfect would recommend your products to all my friends ,1
i have only used this shirt time it alright it does take minute to get used to the low profile my biggest complaint is that it didn come with charger as stated now have to find charger that will fit or spend more money to purchase charger just to ensure can recharge it ,1

i in love with my speaker the sound quality is amazing the battery lasts for long time and it so easy to connect it to my phone and devices connected it to my laptop to watch movie and it made me feel like was in movie theater again highly recommended buying this speaker ,1
i like that it recharges and doesn require batteries it doesn last that long though but seems to recharge good enough after only being plugged in for even minutes wish it came with longer charge cord since you could then use also with charging cable plugged in still can but very short cord ,1

i like these it has good sound quality sometimes feel like there pulsing that isn from the computer but my computer has had sound issues since got it so not quick to blame the headphones did get them for gaming and so far have worked better than my other headphones especially mic wise ,5
i loved this mouse used it for few hours of office work once every week or two so very light use in the scheme of things for computer mouse received it end of june and it is currently middle of december so about months until the roller scroller part of the mouse broke ,1

i loved this product when first received it it lit up and lightweight and just pretty but that was very short lived it stopped working after just weeks of using it good thing it was on the cheaper side maybe it was disposable mouse that only was supposed to work for short period ,5

i really enjoyed this mouse at st due to my job but less than months of using it it has completely stopped working one of the girls work with owns similar mouse and when mine stopped working it actually worked with her laptop even though the mouse chip was plugged into my laptop ,1
i think everything else was good about this it just that my charger broke really quick and now do not have charger for this it is hard to find charger for this product would make charger stronger because it is really inconvenient for the user would recommend if charger was built with durability ,5
i use it for work time keeping and it does everything need it to light for caps lock ease of inputting shortcuts comfortable for typing since it has two stands in the back lights up so can see the keys when don feel like turning on the lights in my office great product,1
i use this for my xbox partychat never had issue in the past and ve gotten the same one from the same person but the one got recently seems to be little staticky so it constantly in your ears and in somebody else ears other than that they re okay just static gaming,5
i used two charge speakers in my workshop wish jbl could make it so both speakers will turn off and on when one turns bluetooth back on from the same device it appears the jbl speaker does not remember after being turned off or disconnected that it was paired with another jbl device ,5
i wanted my daughter to have good headset so she can talk and play and watch her shows with her cousins when they re far away absolutely love these they look so awesome and light up and have cord that can move around with what lol so far loving them can you tell ,5
i was attracted to this keyboard due mainly to the colorful lighting but after couple of days of use just couldn handle the noise the spacebar made if you use the spacebar lot for gaming you may become distracted and irritated think liked the idea of this keyboard better than the keyboard itself ,1
i was surprised to find out how well these actually are they handle bass very well and the audio is clear and loud you can have the lights on or off and they look pretty cool if you re looking for good quality headset without spending lot of money these are great option ,5
i work at place that supplies cheap basic keyboards and splurged to make my workday better with something that makes me happy how did they let you order that mine is crap etc bought it with my own money to make me smile with the rainbow at my finger tips muhaha love it ,5
it may be pretty to look at but it requires constant charging no warning when low on charge so if you are in the middle of using your usb port to hear music or watch dvd you have to stop unplug it just to charge the mouse very frustrating going back to batteries ,5
it was great until it stopped working won even turn on charged it of course and still doesn work at all time window to return passed really not what you expect from amazon ll be taking steps to get my money back you can bet on that don care how cheap it was ,5

keyboard worked great for the longest time but ive had it for bit over year and now typing is progressively become more difficult due to the lost key presses its got bad enough to affect games now so my player stops and takes stuttering steps before returning back to normal for short while ,5
literally from the box it won light up or download the software to be able to use my mouse won move and it says compatible with mac that is absolutely untrue can you explain to me why that stated in the description it the only reason purchased this and it doesn work disappointed ,1

love using this mouse the led lights are fascinating and fun so easy on the hand and wrist no pressure no numbness or tingling and my hand doesn get tired and achy have carpal tunnel so love the relief get now and know that will be really helpful and appreciated after my surgery ,1
loved this mouse but it breaks super easily liked it and figured give it another chance so bought second one and it broke after months it soft to the touch and very quiet which liked unfortunately both times the scroll button stopped working feels like it detaches you get what you pay for ,1
my boyfriend bought these for gaming and he likes them the only thing he has said is that it feels like it squeezing his ears maybe they re little tight but other than that he loves them he literally wears them for hours sometimes so don think the ear thing is that serious ,5
noise cancellation and output sound was fine however the microphone leaves lot to be desired people on the other end could barely hear me and said sounded like was super far away there is also no way to adjust the microphone so that it sits closer to your face it in fixed position ,1
now that an old man and don need anything super fancy for my desktop replaced deathadder from with it only been using it for about hours but no major complaints so far takes little bit of getting use to because it sits so low but the clicks feel nice and seems fairly responsive ,1

only thing don like about it is that the cable included in the package is only for charging rather than for charging and wired use you must use the wireless adapter for it to work not huge deal but it would be nice if wired use was an option it would make sense ,5
people always ask me about my mouse when use it at school love the colors love that its rechargeable its small and lightweight so its great for what use it for which is with my laptop at school in the lab ve already dropped it few times and it still works no complaints ,1
really disappointed with this product loved it when got it it fit my hand nicely worked like dream then it came time to charge it no matter where plugged it in could not get it to charge not sure if it is just faulty product or if this is just how they are ,5

seemed to work okay for the minute used the mouse for my security camera nvr system but it had scratches around both sides looked to be an obvious return actually my first from amazon because the power cord looked to have been used also will be returning because when buy new expect new ,1
started off great but the charge stopped working couldn tell if it needing charging one day it didn turn on left it to charge while it was off and on hours each way and it still wouldn hold charge or turn on battery ended up exploding and started leaking acid overall horrible product,1

super good quality microphone and headphones bought these to start streaming and the microphone only picks up my voice so don need to worry about background noise being picked up the headphones themselves are also really amazing crystal clear sound highly recommend these to anyone looking for an affordable and great quality headset ,1
the first one had defective charging cord connector very loose and the replacement sent promptly starts fine and gets steadily slower and more and more draggy and must be turned off and on again to start working normally both were returned under warranty and won be reordered again neat but not good quality ,5

the jbl speaker is very good high quality speaker the speaker sounds great and like it because it also waterproof and would recommend this to my family and friends also like the other feature where you can play another jbl speaker at the same time and would probably buy another one as well ,1
the keyboard constantly lags and has issues with bluetooth even when connect directly via usb have this lag issue sometimes the keyboard spazzes out while working on something that requires extreme precision if you are using this keyboard for coding or sending important emails then be warned that you might have connectivity issues ,1
the microphone barely detects audio if you re talking at volume any less than screaming painfully uncomfortable to wear with glasses and the sound quality isn much better than my old headset which ve had for years even for only expected something could use for at least minutes before it gave me headache ,1
the microphone on these headphones didn seem to work at first but then found it had to be in just the right spot which is not normal they also do not light up like the picture shows them doing this doesn affect how they are used but they shouldn advertise them lighting up ,1
the mouse arrived today easy to set up so far it is working properly like the fact that it rechargeable no more aa battery to replace ll have to get use to its size lot shorter than my old morosoft mouse hope it lasts as long as the old mouse time will tell ,1

the mouse is sturdy and the rainbow lighting feature is fun it auto shuts off after minutes think which is great for saving the battery thought that having to put it on charger would be major inconvenience it not at all the recharge is quick and only do it once week so far ,5

the sound is awesome and has very good bass what like most is that it is rechargeable by usb connection and it is small enough to carry inside small backpack nevertheless the sound is loud enough to be heard across sq ft apartment or more and between walls great speaker for the money ,1
this gaming headset is the perfect amount of quality for the price you get the noise cancellation is great and the sound quality is not bad at all bought them as gift and the reciever was incredibly happy to be on the other end using these extremely happy with the product will recommend ,5
this is almost decent keyboard unfortunately some keys are in very unusual positions for example single apostrophe should be directly left of enter key and backslash should be directly above it this may not be important for casuals but this is anathema for coders didn use it long enough to test battery life ,1
this is great keyboard except for the fact that the enter key is not wide enough the backslash key takes the place of where the first bit of the enter key should go will probably end up returning because don want to relearn how to type to make up for smaller enter key ,1
this is very nice product the mouse does not need pad can work on the bare desk on sheet of paper etc my device does not have multiple leds only red or the software use does not employ all its features but there is no need to complain will buy again without hesitation ,1

this mouse is almost unusable because of how loud every scroll is took the top off to make sure there wasn something stuck in there to create this awful sound and it was clean just poorly designed cheap wasn expecting the greatest mouse for this low price point but this is just obnoxious ,5

this mouse looks good but that it it works poorly finally gave up and went back to my old wired mouse it just doesn work well you end up wildly moving it around and getting the cursor to where you want it to click on something is struggle would not recommend this mouse ,5

this thing almost caught fire melted port and cable now could have got dud get it but this is unacceptable period even contacted there customer support and what joke they did not take it serious at all pretended to transfer me to another dept and hung up on me please buy something else ,5
this was christmas gift that was big hit the sound is wonderful and it very portable in trip to az we simply threw it into our computer bag and it went right with us we ve had one initial charge and it been playing for days for the bluetooth we used jbl charge ,5
when first bought it felt bit skeptical about the product but when tried it out was definitely amazed with how much of difference it made in the sound quality of my games and honestly fell like this would be my go to product if ever so find myself needing new pair of headphones ,1
ya know for almost thought be more impressed sound quality isn bad but the bass interferes with the sound quality and makes it wobbly to where scared to play it loud ue doesn do that like others mentioned too it is mono speaker which isn great when looking for full directional quality sound,5
after few months of use obviously past the return window the scroll wheel on the mouse does not track any scrolls and spins almost like wheel on skateboard the led also stopped working if were to purchase again it would have to be considerably less with the frequency have to buy them ,5

after months the jbl charge will no longer take charge this is pretty frustrating issue as it new device we ve only used handful of times there are lot of articles about it online but fixing it is difficult for someone who not familiar electronics and there lot of trouble shooting involved ,5
bought this to replace my old jbl bluetooth speaker that finally bit the dust after years of being pool speaker in the texas heat this one was major upgrade the sound is great and it connects easily every time ve used it the battery seems to last forever too which is great ,1
for me you had to have the headphone jack in certain spot and stay still for the sound to stay on it works only sometimes but the more you move the more it cuts out but the sound was very clear and my party could hear me clear when it did work ,1
for this is the best wireless mouse ve ever used set it up in two minutes feels good in my hand the scrolling wheel is nice and the clicking is silent cannot stand loud clicking mice got this for my work computer and think also going to get one for my laptop ,1

honestly feel really scammed plugged in these headphones into my ps and the sound quality was awful could only hear out of one side of the headphone and that was the microphone side honestly should not have been cheap on gaming headphones and paid for more expensive and high quality gaming accessories,5
i absolutely love this little speaker for its size it is truly incredible and it has been very durable the ability to connect multiple together is very useful connected to of them and not of the larger speakers together and used them as the sound system for my outdoor wedding worked great ,5
i bought this mouse to throw in my laptop bag for those times when the trackpad was too much of pain to use the mouse is slightly small in my hand but is still comfortable and tracks well really appreciate that it charges from micro usb cable great value for the price ,1

i bought two of these speakers and was quite satisfied at first my first would not hold the charge after quite bit of use bought second one and the battery would not hold charge contacted the company and was never contacted the speaker is good battery and customer service is quite questionable ,5
i got these delivered the same day purchased them straight out of the box and mean straight out of the box the headphones on work on the left side the right side had no sound and the microphone doesn work do not waste your money garbage would leave no stars if applicable,5
i had brought the headphones bcuz one blue is my favorite colors and two they were supposed to light up when you plugged them in also the noise cancellation well plugged them in and could still hear the noise and could not hear the ppl whom was playing with very very disappointed ,5
i had one of these already so wanted to get second one to tie into the others it will not stay on for more than seconds it will not take charge have run the factory reset process several times with success for about one week then have speaker with no charge again ,5
i have been using this mouse for about month it had been working perfectly only use it occassionally throughout the day after about month it stopped working while it was on the color changing mode it still works while on the regular red light mode but now not the color changing mode ,1

i have of the jbl go bluetooth speakers that produce tremendous sound quality for such small unit and the portability is the reason bought them recently decided to upgrade to the charge and must say am truly amazed by the incredibly powerful sound quality of this unit don wait buy it today ,5
i have small hands and my old mouse was too big for my hand this mouse is lower so don need to move my wrist and fingers higher to click it not cure but it great that it fits my hand much better and doesn put as much strain on my hand ,5

i like this headset lot because it helps me out lot with gaming and just using it for work it is really comfy and when it comes to gaming it is nice headset to use give this ive had this over months now and it is really great product nothing bad happened ,5
i lobe this speaker and truly lobe the sound and plan on getting another to complete stereo sound no it does not gibe you stereo but sounds good what don like is the bee changing prices on the same item done by amazon bought it lot cheaper than it is right now ,5
i love it iv had it for two years and it great lowkey spilled coffee on it yesterday and the light and everything still works ve spilled multiple things on it and it still good so it is granted waterproof also bought this cover for it to travel with and it fits ,1
i love it portability it loud in proximity but not too obnoxiously loud to disturb neighbors when use it in my open garage it connects quickly and it easy to pair battery life lasts much longer than jbl flip lastly purchasing strap accessory is good investment so you can carry it around ,5
i loved this mouse it was slick and easy to use however it was not once used on regular basis only used it may hour max each day the charge did not hold and here am less than year in and it no longer holds charge tried to return but not accepted ,1

i must admit bought these due to price have found they do not cancel exterior noise at all as am able to hear the tv and conversations very easily while wearing the headset would also note that after minutes or so they tend to be painful and am forced to remove them ,5
i purchased one of these before and it was really nice like the way it looks and feels it pretty accurate and has good sensitivity and this one got card in it that said get this one for free don know how cuz can read chinese and the instructions are in chinese ,1
i started with the jbl charge and was surprised how long it survived before had to retire it and upgrade to the jbl charge these speakers are built to last and have amazing sound quality as well as battery life will be an owner of this line of bluetooth speaker for life ,1
i use these for gaming music videos schoolwork pretty much everything spanning both pc and console experiences they work great and still work great after almost year of ownership the chord is tad unwieldy with its length and the headphones aren ideal for noise canceling other than that can find any issues ,1
i use this everyday in my postal truck carry it in the rain charge it once week with one or two out of five battery life lights left sound quality is excellent and pairs to my phone easily use it to hours day definitely one of the best portable speakers ve owned,5
i would give it stars if could my husband loves it very loud and great for outside at the lake we lost it in the lake for weeks and found it at the neighbors by their dock best part is it still works no sound quality loss or anything would highly recommend ,5
if you are looking for great quality gaming headset this is what you are looking for the sound range of the headset is great the noise cancellation is fantastic can see my fianc talking to me and just nodding cuz honestly can hear anything of what he is saying am very pleased ,5
it bit bulky but find hear clearly like that it has volume button have it for months now and it hasn broken yet although it does feel bit wobbly like it could break if you re not caref with it the microphone could be longer so others can hear you more clearly,1
it great mouse perfect and just what was looking for it really quiet which appreciate because louds clicks do get annoying after some time but not with this mouse the lights are cool too really slim so it easy to pack in my work bag and it feels great while using it ,1

it takes too long to wake up and the battery dies quickly the instructions were terrible have no idea what the two on settings are for as they are not addressed at all seems to do what basic mouse is supposed to do but would look elsewhere for higher quality next time ,1
it was great present for friend of mine because while gaming he couldn talk because his old expensive headset broke fast so far it been few months and this still works for him he sounds better and the quality is also good not sure how noise cancelation is going for him though ,1
it was great while it lasted this mouse has low profile it easy on the hands and eye pleasing white the internal battery holds charge well used it for work hr day and but it suddenly stopped working after few days short of months will look for something more durable for replacement ,5
it was great while it worked with the first one that got then it started not working and messaged the sellers and they send me another one tell me how the new one didn work at alllll such terrible product don waste your money or your time trying to make it work ,1

last weekend took this speaker on floating trip down the river know it said it was waterproof but let me tell you our tube flipped over and the speaker was mia mins later we found it floating down the river picked it up and started playing music again was stunned awesome speaker ,5
love the keyboard in every way except when am using it and suddenly even in the middle of game it stops working completely and needs to be charged it won work while charging either you have to wait for it to be done if you can get on schedule you re good ,5
my son goes through headphones quickly not certain what he does to them these are holding up well to the abuses of kid they have good noise cancelling because he can hear me when try to talk to him the short fixed boom is wired well and seems to be holding up ,5

really great keyboard gamer and have had zero issues it has quick response time can tell the difference between this and my wired razor black widow keyboard my only feedback for the company would be to provide some sort of indication software or hardware based of how much battery life there is ,1
sadly no one said in the comments that the sound is piss poor and no one can hear you speak there no setting to adjust and oddly enough both connections are on the same cord returning these because have zero use for them spend little more money and get something of value ,5
some people will hate and say these are bad headphones cuz they re cheap ve been using these forever their sound quality is great and the mic quality is just as good as any other mix no need to spend hundreds on mic and headphones when you can get it for cheap ,5
the battery doesn even last one day pretty much have to keep it plugged in at all times and have the light setting turned off it looks like nice mouse and the wheel and clicking is fine but what the point if it never charged don waste your money on this mouse ,1

the good thing is this mouse is cheap but it feels like it too the wheel is terrible and the buttons are not even or flush and when moving from the wheel to the buttons your finger catches on the button other than feeling really cheaply made it functions as it should,1

the headphones are great they are very comfortable and has good sound quality for an affordable price don recommend using the headphones on laptops because it bent weird and messed up the wiring so bought another one and use the messed up one for the laptop other than that they are great ,5
the headset is really comfortable it feels natural on the head my friends can hear me really well when play and hear them just fine you can hear what going on out side the headset but not real well use it for gaming and really like it over all really good headset ,1
the keyboard worked fine for short while then the battery would lose its charge and while it is charging it would heat up the keyboard input area that it burnt my finger it finally died on me the other day so threw it away just for fyi was using their charging cord ,5
the mouse functions well especially like the colorful lights however the battery is kind of pain it lasts for only days even when it is in sleep mode have to remember to charge it everyday which unfortunately am not good at ended up using my old mouse as backup every few days ,5

the mouse no matter how much charge it no longer turns on or connects to my computer normally try to avoid making negative reviews but this is honestly not worth the money spent on this all wanted was mouse to help me work on my macbook and this was just huge disappointment ,1

the sound from the headphones are good however the microphone is barely picking up any sound ve adjusted sensitivity levels and microphone boost to no avail the only way it picks up sound is if by hand pull the mic closer to my mouth which kind of defeats the purpose super unfortunate ,5
these do not work with computers windows does not recognize them and no software exists to help you can hear people but the mic does not let people hear you they work great on laptops the mic and lights are problematic noise canceling and comfort are spot on with everything except computers ,5
these headphones are great value for the price of once put the headphones on was so surprised of the sound quality and noise reduction first listened to music on it and it was not so bad then started playing video games and it was better than headset got then returned on amazon ,5
this is horrible product my son has gone through two of these keyboards and they do not hold up keep their charge they both were used for about weeks before they would not keep their charge and would stop working within few minutes after charging all night this product is absolute garbage ,1
this keyboard goes in and out will work then stops now its has stop working don buy call warranty co and was told to make claim they provide the wrong site so the claim that was submitted was for their clothing rep didn refer me to another site amazon wasn useful either ,5
this mouse is awesome it charges quickly and comes with an adapter for the new apple mac plug thing hated my other dell mouse and this one is so smooth quick to react and quiet never thought it would make difference but my students can not hear my annoying clicking anymore recommend ,1

this mouse was delivered missing of the track strips on the bottom of the mouse decided to use it anyways since that shouldn impact the function it worked for few days and then started having problems have to click several times before can get response from it it also barely holds charge ,1
update after working with the company they refunded my faulty headphones they told me that they have new manufacturer use that information to decide if you are willing to risk it at the price offered thankful they at least tried to rectify the issue hope they don keep selling the faulty product ,5
we bought three of these for christmas party they can be linked and volume can be controlled individually they sound great and lasted the whole party without having to be charged they are small enough to not be cumbersome but large enough to fill room with sound very impressed for the money ,5
we finally find good replacement for our old wireless keyboard this one is good had tried using it to play dark souls even the keyboard is about meters away from my pc it still very responsive while playing this game very satisfied no return this time and certainly stars for this item ,5
we received the headset today my year old son put them on to play but the ear muffs are way to small they hurt his ears my husband and also tried them on to see what he was talking about when he said they hurt and they actually do hurt your ears ,1
when received product knew it was what wanted nice raised keys nice crisp click then of course after throwing awaythe box and packaging and really getting down to using it irealized the cap key does not work urgh my mistake for sure make sure you use it for while before discarding anything ,1
works beautifully has same problem all head phones have how long before the cable snaps and the jack falls off took some tooth picks and electrical tape to make sort off splint around the jack confident it will hold if you have the same problem with head phones try that method stars ,5
after day or the mouse would not work at all it was not problem with the connection my computer was able to pick up the bluetooth no problem the mouse itself would not work unless it was plugged into some sort of charger kind of defeats the purpose of wireless mouse ,1

been looking for good first wireless keyboard that won break the bank and have been pretty satisfied ve used this keyboard for weeks and haven had any issues the keyboard itself is very lightweight as for gaming ve had no issues across multiple games great starter wireless keyboard for the price ,5
depending on what you want like in gaming keyboard this keyboard fits in well my husband loves it and have seen an improvement in his gaming it also has nice authestic with the lights the lights do not get crazy bright but are bright enough to notice and creates an atmosphere ,5
does exactly what needed it to do good sound quality fits snuggly only minor complaint is the length of the cord but that on me for not just hooking it up in the back and honestly in hindsight that more of gripe then complaint definitely not something hold against the product,5
first let me say that this jbl portable speaker isn toy this has weight to back up the power sound it brings so if your looking to bring your party anywhere this speaker will bring it it also waterproof but don recommend anyone taking there party to the shower sound check ,5
first time charging this mouse started smelling burnt plastic smell in my home walked over to where it was charging and noticed the smell was lot stronger reached down to unplug it and the cord was red hot had not been in that room it would have started fire not happy ,1

got this as birthday present sounds quality was ok but the max sound is not very high could also never get the mic to work even after about an hour troubleshooting would not recommend to other buyers spend few more bucks for something better quality if you plan to game often ,1
had issue with keyboard purchased for my granddaughter klim customer service reps went totally out of their way to fix the problem above and beyond can tell you for fact that if you need any help klim customer service won jerk you around totally impressed will definitely purchase from them again ,1
honestly the soft push of the keys feel weird maybe because used to laptop keyboard with very shallow keys and friends boards with more clicky keys it doesn feel satisfying to type with connectivity was super easy and the lights are nice there is slight buzzing sound from the lights however ,5
hubby says these are more comfy to wear than the ones bought him last christmas he plays cod and said that they cancel out the noise of the household going on around him and he able to wear them for several hours without them hurting his ears or head at all ,1
i bought one of these for my son to replace the old broken one he had after getting this setup tried them and was pretty impressed with the sound quality so ordered another one honestly for the price it exceeds my expectation it works and the bass is solid buy it ,1
i bought this as christmas gift for my wife and it turned out excellent the sound is as good or better than her old clunky bose that was twice the size of this highly recommend this product it great the design the buttons and the performance have been awesome so far ,5
i got it for my husband he chose his colors lol it worked with daily use for about month until it died that when we figured we have to charge it which was fine but we cannot figure out how to tell when the battery is low and it needs charging ,1
i got these for my boyfriend birthday he loves them they for sure noise cancel because have to scream at him for him to hear me you would have to connect the light usb to power source if you re not gaming on computer but works great for his daily use ,1
i got these for my son to use for his switch and he loves them like that you can control the volume on them and turn the mic on and off they also cancel lot of the background noise so it is easier for you to concentrate and hear the game ,1

i like the keyboard it works great the battery life is pretty decent has low button noise soft button presses just wish it would take longer for it to go into sleep mode and if there were different light up options to choose from but all in all pretty good product ,5
i liked this mouse until it broke two days outside of the return window the roller for the scroll function broke while was scrolling was nothing but gentle with this mouse and it only lasted days it is nice looking the colored lights are not obnoxious and it is very quiet ,5
i love be good sterio gaming headset because high quality sound and bass in the headset is so amazing shooting guns while gaming plus hearing stuff behind you in game your are playing also love how you can connect the usb and your headset can light up while you use them,5
i love the option to turn off the lights it is nice that its rechargeable and can be used while charging if needed the color got was mint color do not recall what it was listed as it is fun color and the light on the mouse are an added bonus ,5
i love this mouse for the most part the colors are vivid and it feels nice in my hand the only downside is that the right click has tendency to stick even when am only using the left click ve had it for few days now and that the only negative ,5

i not pc gamer but spend lot of time on my personal pc during the day wanted something inexpensive with backlit keyboard and number pad and this fits the bill the keys do make an audible click so it not silent really like the value of this keyboard and the design ,5
i placed the device on shelf and kept it there after opening after days of use for about minutes each day without any disturbance the sound all of sudden started to crackle all mid and low range frequencies were gone performed hard reset multiple times per the instructions without any change ,5
i really like this mouse it is low profile and fits my small hands perfectly the only thing really don like about it is all the flashes of different color lights on it need to check to see if there is way to disable the light feature otherwise very nice mouse ,1

most to all iphone eqs sound good on this speaker however the bass could be touch louder other than that it bit heavy so when take it places it usually ends up taking up the middle of the passenger seat or the backseat nonetheless max volume on this thing packs punch ,5
mouse is pretty solid all around except about day after started using it the wheel started squeaking figure it might go away in time nope months later still squeaking and getting more irritating by the day working in an quiet office it is loud enough that other people can hear it ,5

not horrible it just good basic gaming headset my old wired turtle beach headset still sounds better than this thing got that headset during xbox days and they are still better than this one sound wise it to be expected at this price point suppose you get what you pay for ,5
pros the price sleek design wireless easy plug and play cons space bar is extremely wobbly for claiming this to be silent the other keys are satisfactory to say the most in relevance to silent keys additionally the lights come on only if it being used which isn much of con ,5
says it wireless keyboard and when the internal rechargeable batteries get low to recharge it however they do not provide any recharging cable an apple iphone user and none of my cables work tried going to the website to get any info for charging but there was none to be found,5
so basically was testing the removable keycaps to see if the they actually worked so tried it on the space bar and after took it out couldn get it back in and when got it back in it kept falling out idk if this was my fault or the keyboards fault ,5
so got them have an xbox series and the mic wasn working but now the sound on them rant working and idk what happening bc they work on my phone but not my xbox which don make sense they are really great quality but for me they re just not working,5
so it possible this is good device however the keyboard receiver combo received is triple malfunctioning it lags excessively between input and recognition tried all usb ports to confirm the sleep mode activates within seconds of disuse so even input tests are wonky and receiving range is maybe ft at best ,1
super cute mouse love the color and love the led lights my only issue is that it very glitchy like it seems to want to do its own thing which isn good sit at desk for hours and it completely flat surface and the mouse will move all on its own ,1

the absolute best blue tooth speaker money can buy crisp clear sound with hard hitting bass can charge your smart phone and can withstand being submerged in water got great deal on this bad boy and bought the coolest color available so much power in small body jbl continues to deliver ,5
the backlight doesn stay on only works when you re actually typing which is strange but can definitely live with it good quality otherwise keys are well made and are painted so you can see them even when it not lit up has multiple lighting modes that really can figure out,5
the description says that it is adapter for macbook air this is not true you have to plug adapter into laptop and then the usb wireless tab into the adapter had know had to use an adapter would not have bought this can not return as need it now very disappointed ,5

the mouse was stunning when first got it it was very fluent but the one problem and very major problem for me was the fact that the mouse kept left clicking every time right clicked and my chromebook didn have setting to fix it overall it was just an annoying issue ,5

the sound is awesomely fantastic jbl is worth every penny the bass is beautiful the battery is long lasting can charge it to full and don hav to charge it again for another days sometimes longer jbl is great product tried other bluetooth speakers always go bak to jbl no comparison ,5
the sound is fine for the money but the microphone is really bad we had to go into the sound settings and turn up the gain ton just to make it to where people could here the user on comms thus the sound quality is garbage with all the background noise ,1
these headphones work perfectly have to tell at my kid so that he can notice me lol so the noise cancelation works and don have to tell him to turn his gear down because we can hear it blasting away these were the perfecto gift for that gamer in your house ,5
they worked well for while lately have been causing feedback to the mic which ofc makes them unusable not really sure what might have caused this issue all of sudden whether it zoom meetings or gaming being told that when speak there is an feedback loop upgrading to something better guess ,5
this came on time exactly as described it is quieter when you click the buttons than regular mouse it easy to charge and works well it wireless which is great it works perfectly with my sons laptop and the games he plays on it have no complaints would recommend to anyone ,1

this cheaper yet good quality head set use it for gaming and it works well the mic doesn work well on pc but that ok because don use the mic one side of the headphones stopped working at one point but just had to unplug it and plug it back in ,1
this device sounds great it little bass heavy when listening indoors but outdoors it just right the only thing dislike is the charging indicators being on the bottom of the device so you have trouble seeing them when charging for the price it would have been nice to include usb charger ,5
this headset came with the microphone not even working it wouldn show up on my computer it either the headset is broke or the cord is and on top of that you can hear what going on in the headset even if you re not the one wearing it very disappointed ,5
this mouse was back to school gift for my th grade son it charged fine the first time worked ok never charged again and stopped working school has only been in for one week and he already needs new mouse can give it more that one star if it doesn work ,1

this portable speaker packs big sound in small package it offers truly great sound quality easy instant pairing to my iphone and nice design aesthetic got this to replace bose soundlink that was adorable and smaller but finicky when pairing with my phone very happy with this purchase for poolside tunes ,5
this product is awesome love how the sound quality is perfect and the only thing is that after about hours it starts hurting your ears but barley but overall love this product so would totally recommend buying this and ve looked at many headphones and this was the best one yet ,5
this very cute mouse works seemlessly and well comes with some charge so it works out of the box there are modes on off and light changing which is really nice the scroll wheel is smooth but pressing on it is bit stick all in all great buy for great price,5
truly mediocre mouse yes it lights up in different color but everything about this mouse is mediocre cheap feel the scroll does not work very well the click is not very good movement of actual mouse is not smooth don be taken in by the pictures trust the previous poor reviews ,5
we have two other smaller jbl speakers flip which we really liked but wanted bit larger one to connect to those to have full stereo effect and we re not disappointed in fact this one took over the top fav spot above the flip good sound good battery stamina good size ,5
we went on long vacation so worked part of the time having meetings in the car the people on the other end were able to hear me and not background noise from the road even in torrential rain was also able to hear them clearly it was exactly what hoped for ,5
when buying gaming gear you got to look at the price for this pricepoint this keyboard is easily stars responsive great for typing battery lasts for days gaming on budget definitely worth it only con is the layout of the enter key but once you get used to it it fine ,5
 let me start off this review by saying was very excited to get this mouse because it matched my desk my bedroom and my laptop perfectly absolutely loved the mouse right up until two weeks of having it and it completely stopped working don waste your money not worth it ,1
 loveddddddd my mouse super excited but used to clicking the scrolling piece to create the auto scroll well did it and now my scrolling piece is broken sooooo don push the scrolling piece but overall love it and it instantly connected to my macbook pro and everything was working great ,5
 the keyboard is nice and quiet and feels great to type on the achilles heel is the space bar arguably the most used key on the board produces cacophonous smack upon use all the keys are silent but the space bar just want to wake the neighbors it very distracting ,5
as soon as got it never would shut off was barely louder then my jbl flip noticed awhile ago that no sound comes from the right side of the speakeridk if this is just faulty system or if its every speaker but for the money paid definitely not worth it,5
batteries would be so much easier with the way the power runs out after charging by usb frustrating because if your in the middle of something have to go back to old mouse until this mouse is ready to use love the feel of it though and the cool lights ,1

besides driver totally dropping my package on my door step and watched him act like he didn tthis speaker is great the only thing wish it had like the jbl flip is its own sperate volume instead relying off just solely the phones volume this is great for hr shift,5
bought this one thinking it was the bigger one before the boombox turned out to be the next one after the flip had flip before this charge sounds just like it it basically flip with extra battery life if your looking for bigger sound go with the extreme or boombox ,5
broke within two hours of using it you really gotta watch the amazon return policy on electronics have tendency to buy it and leave it sitting in the box for way too long bad me because this is the second or third time ve gotten burned on crap like this ,1

cannot use the product due to false marketing had to research this product extra and finally found that the last picture shows chart again on the last page saying an adapter is needed the original page on amazon shows xbox one is supported as it comes that is false marketing ,1
everything is perfect but the whole point while got this was because its wireless but wireless is useless if theres no reception after feets after year or so can remember it stopped working all it does now is just flashing light back and forth when try to type something in ,5
friend who this was bought for said the headphones had good sound quality from his games he was playing but the microphone is muffled and you can barely make out what he saying through voice chat probably ok if you don care about being heard the design looks nice enough ,5
got this for my son for his birthday he loved it it works great and looks awesome my son said he can hear anything from the outside so the noise cancellation is legit the sound quality is very clear and hasn had any problems used it for his xbox one,5
got to say that am fan of these speakers bought of them after hearing friends charge and was sold on the sound out of the box these fired up and pumped out the jams extremely easy to use and link together looking forward to getting these out in the beach ,5
great bought for child and he loves it works exactly as advertised he says their comfortable and he can hear everything like how it has the audio jack and usb usb is just for the power to the lights so he can use them on his tablet or the computer ,5
great set of gaming headphones my husband and my kids both agree this was good purchase like the design and it perfect for adults and children sits comfortable on the head and gives good sound and others can hear you as well when playing online very happy with this product ,5
great value for money for an average user like me think this is great value the bose sound link has the degree sound but its about bucks more im willing to sacrifice that for the price plus this is waterproof and can be taken to the beach pool and shower,1
has this headset for over years and have no complaints super comfortable so you can wear them for long time with no irritation nice click for the mute feature if you re like me and need to check if you re muted or not this is the headset for you ,5
i barely use my keyboard sit on couch and watch netflix etc aka don even use it for gaming and after like months at least the button the button don work whatsoever they say the keyboard lasts at least decade hmmmmmmm buy something else as now have to as well,5
i bought by keyboard in had no issues until of the keys started getting stuck after heavy use about hours per day for year contacted customer service since it was under warranty and was sent brand new keyboard instantly without an exchange would strongly recommend this company and their products,1
i bought these for my year old daughter she has place to put them away safely and is great with taking care of her stuff today she went to plug these into her tablet th use and the headphone plug pulled out of the cord very disappointed in the quality,1
i bought this in late june it looks cool with the lights and all it doesn give warning that the battery is low just stops working now it is doing all kinds of weird stuff clicking on items that you didn etc too late to return oh well not recommended ,1

i had the jbl charge and the xtreme the sound quality is equal to the charge and didn sound any better at all the style changed but other then that it did not impress besides being smaller it not better then the extreme in any way ended up returning it ,5
i hated this item they described how easy it was to use and received mine and it does not connect after doing my research on it its suppose to be compatible with my laptop and its not so now have to order different one im very disappointed in this product ,1

i haven played games in years was recently gifted google stadia and have started to casually play games with friends online wanted headset but was not ready to spend took chance on these and very pleasantly surprised ve had three hour gaming sessions with no discomfort sound is good thanks ,5
i liked using this mouse but it needed charged lot more than anticipated it looks good and worked good but overall was little too cheaply made and it didn last long it fell thanks to my small children and cracked right open only got to use it couple of months ,1

i love how long the wire is as well as the ability to not use the led light there is also knob on the device to lower or raise the volume wished the mic would go bit closer to the mouth area but seems to be all right for now ,5
i obsessed with this speaker not only is it the perfect size but also didn have to compromise the quality of volume or sound it gets so loud and it still clear have recommended this speaker to lots of my friends also the grey is such good color love it ,5
i probably should have known but the light is either red or it cycles through colors this is probably cool for gamers or middle school kids would rather be able to pick color but that is not feature available which is probably something should have expected but was being hopeful ,5

i really enjoy the feel of the mouse it slick which has put less strain on my wrist but ll still be getting wrist support the colors don need to be turned on and when left in middle it keeps the mouse on with only the red light from underneath ,5

i really wanted rechargeable mouse as use lot of batteries in my regular wireless mouse work in fast paced computer orientated office type fast and navigate faster the mouse couldn keep up often found myself turning it off and back on because it just wouldn move returned it for refund ,1
i tried to give this mouse some time tried it on different surfaces in all cases it skipped around and was very hard to work with unfortunately because of vacation and because tried to make it work missed the return window by one day that just frustrates me even more ,1

i used this guy for dayssssss upon receiving without charging few times ve had thought had issues with the mouse but had it backwards that my main complaint too easy to put backwards it doesn attract dust and dirt works on every surface ve put it on and it cute,1
i ve been through two of these mice the first one lasted only one day before the scroll wheel stopped working opted for an exchange but the new one had the same issue after about weeks looking through reviews it seems to be common issue returning this for another brand ,1

i ve hooked this up to my ps to use while playing ffxiv and it seamlessly works to type better than the controller does still have to use the controller to get to the chat box but that doesn bug me love the coloring great for use in the dark ,5
i ve only used this product once and it stopped working after only using it for an hour and half after being fully charged it says just two hours of charging can last days but obviously that lie the usb receiver also arrived broken don waste your money on this ,1
i was super exited about this product for my laptop sadly it didn even work after week tried everything to get this mouse to work charging for two days try it on different computer nothing helped the mouse didn even use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements ,1

it looks nice but after using it for few weeks it hasn worked for my online work sometimes it is not so responsive which affects my job performance don know if came across faulty model the usb adapter was not included will try the new one and update my review ,5
it nice looking and the wife absolutely loves it and it vibrant colors got her the mint green one and it works like champ didn like the feel of big flat mouse under my hand but she said that it isn problem and likes it so that the important thing ,5

it really nice everyday mouse the sleep mode is little irritating because it kicks on so quickly and there doesn seem to be way to change it don think it would be great for gaming given its limited buttons and the sleep mode thing but it great for office use ,1

it slim and doesn make noise the colors are great wasn expecting much but this mouse really surpassed what thought was going to get to install is super easy the usb is small so it doesn get in the way the mouse is super slim and the scroll works great ,5
it smaller than used to and light the battery seems to work well and don turn on and off just goes to sleep it has the enter bar in different configuration and is tighter than than used to and that has been change to get accustomed to like it though ,1
it very good had for about months and has not had problem the volume and sound allow for me to hear enemy foot steps the sound nob is good addition so if you are in game you can change the volume without going in and out of the game menu ,5
it was cool when it worked but it stopped working in less than month there were times where would leave it on all night or till the battery died but it doesn charge and the bottom red light just blinks and then shuts off when try to turn it on ,5
it works okay in the first couple of minutes and then the cursor starts to jump other than moving smoothly as the mouse moves also clicks often fail to work at the first button down sometimes several clicks need to trigger an action threw it away and ordered other products ,1
item came fast easy to set up and use love that it is rechargeable and you don have to worry about constantly replacing the batteries use this at work plug it in at night to charge and it lasts all day while work with no issues would recommend this item ,1

its cheap made useless keyboard range is horrible sleep mode activates way to soon lights turn off only after second or so leaving you guessing what key to press if using in the dark battery is horrible lighting is horrible don bother with this one unless its for year old ,1
ive bought headphones from walmart with better sound quality its also apparently designed for babies because cant see anyone else managing to fit their ears in the earcuffs overpriced trash not even worth do not buy now they keep trying to bribe me to delete this review lol what joke,1
keyboard is cute but ve rubbed the letters off after just two months of use and some of the keys don work like they should like ctrl arrow to move over whole word it works to the right but not to the left going to have to replace it soon ,5
kiddo loved these for his pc games he is it was great deal and got great reviews bought these on month later and only one ear piece works and the mic doesn work anymore either can even return them now because the return window closed literally days ago not impressed ,5
my son loves this headset in particular he broke his first one and was so happy to see it at an actual lower price than had purchased before he loves the led features and how clear the sound is will continue to buy this brand everytime he rages in fortnite ,1
needed temporary set of headphones and they do not work with my ps controller don care about the lights which need to be connected via usb but the audio does not work with my ps works perfectly fine on my laptop but not on my ps which is extremely annoying ,5
not bad for the price the top part hits pressure points on the head so you have to move it whwn you feel soreness don twear them for longer than maybe hours so it kinda disappointing but value for what paid is great not bad at all for temporary set ,5
of course didn expect high quality product for this low price but man the mouse didn even last week it dead charged it just one time and dead it could have worked at least half year just can believe that amazon let sellers like this run business on their platform ,1
overall great keyboard and rechargeable too the computer doesnt give you any warning whatsoever when the battery is low or dead so it might cut out mid use similarly the battery life isn stellar but that to be expected of light up keyboard overall good value at its price point ,5
overall really like them they re fairly solid product comfortable to wear sound quality it good they feel sturdy and easy to operate the only complaint have is that the cord is little bulky and cumbersome but even with that actually kind of glad that its sturdy and feels durable ,5
repeatedly and without proper functioning my mouse turned on for second then turned right back off again after being plugged into the laptop overnight searched for power issue reviews and found am not the only one cannot recommend this product and feel it should be taken down due to this ,1

right out the box you can hear perfectly but couldn be heard it said my microphone was on and making noise but no one could hear me did not glow blue at all cord was already lose and when you move it sound would jump and go in and out,5
so disappointed this promised to be cute and functional mouse but it never worked not even for day charged it followed all directions am tech proficient and it wouldn even turn on feels cheap too so not surprised so disappointing to purchase things that don work all too common anymore ,1

sorry usually dont leave bad reviews but this one takes the cake it started working at first but then it started to be very laggy and then no longer worked now am using brand new macbook so maybe it the usb converter that might be problem but currently not fan ,5

sound is very good for single speaker with excellent bass response an adjustable eq vis phone app would be nice but still sounds great where this thing shines is battery life ve had it for few months and am still working on the first chafe and use this speaker daily ,1
speakers have trouble connecting to bluetooth tried resetting and still get distorted sound when connecting to stereo mode thru the jbl app the sound is good and am sure the battery life is fantastic possible got bad set box appeared to have been previously opened sending back and getting replacement ,5
suddenly died out of nowhere purchased in march when started my first pc build currently have no response from keyboard in wireless or wired mode tried using it on several machines to make sure it was not just me works fine in the beginning but long term is no go ,5
terrible product only reason still have it is because amazon told me just to keep it when requested return and refund battery doesn last at all feels terrible in your hand and the buttons and scroll ball are not accurate stay away there are plenty of other cheap rgb mice ,5

the item is supposed to wake up after turning itself off in order to save battery but mine never did had to turn it off and then on again and then after days the cursor began moving wildly by itself and then later that day the buttons stopped working entirely ,1

the mouse is fine for typical home use but the dongle drives me crazy remove it from my laptop when it not in use and put it back under the mouse its pretty difficult to remove it again without some kind of sharp edge feel like it will eventually break ,5

the mouse works great until it goes to sleep agggh then you have to shake tap hard against your palm so you don smash it to pieces or flip the switch back and forth it quite irritating if it was as simple as on and off it would be perfect ,1

the packaging was very nice the box is high quality box that won get damaged during shipping the overall appearance when first seeing the headset was previously purchased headset that was more then double the price of the and they fell apart headset is great price and they look great ,5
the sound quality is perfect definitely the defining feature was playing fps where it was raining in game and had to stop to check if it was coming from outside the rest of the headset is easy to use for pc and console gaming would definitely recommend for any gamer,5
the type extension doesn work so it rendered it useless for my mac am able to use it on my pc for work just not the intended use bought it for the mouse itself is great light easy to use fits perfectly in my hand always connects and is reliable ,1

these things are awesome paid don use them for gaming so no rating but the sound quality is so good the only problem is they don adjust any smaller and rest bit heavy on my head they do have cushion though so that helps and my ears are completely covered ,1
this is rechargable and therefore not wireless it must be plugged in to wire in order to recharge this is huge pain to have to deal with connecting it and tripping over wires etc for hours while it recharges compared to just swapping out some aa batteries in few seconds ,5
this speaker has amazing sound and love the fact that if you have multiple jbl speakers you can sync them all little heavier than would have liked for beach bag but no too heavy at all ve already taken this speaker on three trips with me and it been hit ,1
this was absolutely the worst headset ever received had bought the adapter and plugged it into my xbox controller the sound was so far away even on high volume the quality was bad it looks nicer in the picture than it actually is would not recommend this item at all,5

decent mouse looks and feels cheap and the light show kinda adds to the cheapness of the mouse cursor tracking is the biggest issue the cursor doesnt track consistently smooth when moving it around on the screen and the dts button doesn seem to do anything for controlling this ,5

keyboard over all is ok space bar sucks as it only works dead center and is very clicky did not want wireless unit but when you change to jet black you don get any choice it just shows up that way even though in black it is wired beware,5
overall sound is good but doesn get very loud almost certain my flip was louder and more even in sound this would be good with another to run in stereo but the bass is still lacking unless you put it in spot with lot of sound deflection or corner ,1
perfect budget mouse if your working with macbook like am very smooth and responsive but wouldn recommend for gaming because any crazy fast movement can kind of lag but for my online studies it been perfect very very long battery life don think ve charged it since bought it ,1

rgb is good with on off and breathing very small and light keys are close together and not too loud main thing is it doesn hold charge for long if you game lot this keyboard only lasts not even days no warning just shuts off at the perfect time ,5
so bought this few days ago and the first day of using it which was yesterday the color changing lights worked and now only the red light works this is bs turned it off for mins to give it rest but nope the lights still don work don recommend,5

sound quality is horrific find speaker like the jbl extreme or that has stereo sound instead god awful even when plugged in with an aux connection instead of bluetooth stay away form this product and heed the warning of the other reviews about this speaker only having mono sound,1
the keypad tends to leave off some letters after prolonged use had to keep retyping some letters and in some cases it actually doubled up on the letters the charge doesn last long either all in all am somewhat satisfied with it but believe it has few inherent flaws ,1
the microphone doesnt work with ps went through all of the troubleshooting steps twice and the mic is digital garbage at best and completely unresponsive at worst wish had looked deeper into the reviews before adding to my wish list and having people waste their money on this product,1
the product was quite obviously not new the product box not the shipping box was damaged and had return labels peeled off the keyboard had corner broken off and there was dust all over it the dongle for wireless use was not included nor were any cords horrible experience ,1
the sound quality on these headphones are really good one of my friends who uses them for gaming recommended them to me and said they ve last him long time so far ve had no issues the sound cancelation is also amazing compared to my last pair of headphones,5
the speaker is great it came charged so got to use it immediately ve had one before but it was shared family speaker so now can take mine wherever want to and the color is cute great speaker over all sounds amazing and they stay charged for long time ,5
there is no lighting up of the headset unless very short cord is in the usb same time as the other that is plugged into the gaming unit that falsely advertised it sounds good and works good but no lights at all that mainly why picked this one bummer ,1
these do not cover the ears well and therefore let in lots of sound from the outside am coming from an old pair of hyperx headphones they were great other than not having an online volume these bengoo units are absolutely horrible head is throbbing within minutes of wearing ,1
these work well and the sound quality is good they completely cover the ears and seem to be comfortable enough they rest on the pad on top of the head and would probably get tired of that with extended wear but overall they are good product at good price ,5
they feel like cheap plastic and the sound isn that great not fan of the cord either but that personal preference they work if you re looking for cheap headphones and don care edit bought these when they were at least half the price these are not worth dollars,1
this headset works alright for being made of cheap feeling and looking plastic it does the job but the sound quality is not good and there practically no noise cancellation it also only lights up when its plugged in highly suggest saving your money and getting better quality headset ,1
this is great buy and they have amazing customer service so had to buy this wireless keyboard especially for my second monitor lastly it lasts very long like days long my only wish is for hair trigger like keys for rhythm games or fps but other wise great buy ,1
this is great wireless mouse at great price it comes with usb charger and quickly connected to my laptop it feels great on my palm and the cursor moves around the screen smoothly love the ability to change the mouse lighting and love how lightweight but durable it is ,5

i professional who writes lot and thought on giving this low budget keyboard try it is not suitable for heavy writing work as it becomes really heavy on the hands after few thousand words it is however well designed keyboard that can be used for simple daily computing ,5
i purchased this headset for my son for christmas it seemed to work fine for around months but as of now the mic no longer works how friends can hear him he can hear anyone else so he can no longer even use them total waste of money ,5
i purchased this mouse as the wheel on my old one quit working loved the design and wanted another so ordered it and received it aug it is oct and the wheel just quick working again would recommend looking at different mouse if you prefer your scrolling feature ,1

i recently bought this for my son it perfect we ve had issues with soo many head sets being cheap quality this one is must love the color options as well his favorite color is orange so he loving this please order if you are considering buying one ,5
i ve had my speaker for about months now the cord got really messed up and stopped charging the speaker and it would take days to get it to of the charging bubbles fully had it charging the whole day and it only got to bubble icon fully ,5
i ve had them minutes haven even plugged them in yet but they are very comfortable think it odd that the extension part above each ear only slides in and out just tiny bit would have thought quality headphones would give you more room for adjustment just thought ,5
i wanted cheapish head set for my bf at the time and saw this and figured ok why not the cord is super long so you can sit anywhere in the room you re playing in and have good reach on wire it sounds good and works good ,5
if you re programmer or generally use the ctrl shift key combo please skip this the left ctrl shift combination doesn work so you ll have to retrain yourself to use the right only apparently this is known and ongoing issue it not worth the time or effort ,1
im so mad my keyboard is broken in some letters and numbers and don know if you sent me the quality keyboard am very disappointed with your keyboard used days it is very good and after that it was damaged hope you read this comment then refund me,5
it super cute and love how it lights up which is probably the reason why the charge doesn last very long just make sure you stay on top of it and it will work trying to avoid buying one with batteries but this one is in any better ,5
it works great for what use it for bring it into my shop when working on my projects or bring it into the bathroom when want to relax in my jacuzzi tub it is plenty loud but wish it had equalizer on the app to adjust the bass ,5
its great except the cord is way too long there should be no reason why its as long as it is and ve tripped on it couple of times foot tall and it gotten caught under the wheels of my gaming chair other than that it works fine ,5
left ctrl shift keyboard shortcuts are unresponsive on this keyboard meaning this is unusable for my workflow don know how this keyboard is rated so highly and continues to be sold with known hardware issues like this also the spacebar makes an awful twang noise when it tapped ,5
loved it as long as it worked stopped working yesterday even tried charging it again but it wouldn even do that with only month to return if not working am out mouse and must buy another one too bad as really did like this model now onto shopping ,5

might not be ideal for gaming because of the lag but works perfectly for of the situations one charge lasts days of very heavy usage so it convenient at the time of my purchase this was the only wireless backlit proper keyboard and still happy with the purchase ,1
my brand new jbl doesn charge even once hard reset didn work getting new charging cable didn work either had it replaced for another one and faced the same problem again not worth replacing again especially given the unreliability of the battery ll probably get bose or beats ,5
my grandson talked me into this purchase and have to say am enjoying it sound is pretty good for portable small speaker battery life is good so far can usually get about days of from morning till night out of full charge feel satisfied with the charge purchases ,5
my husband has one son two and mom one these are best quality ever and are very versatile in that you can connect them all to each other or just use one or two highly recommended if you are looking for portable speaker you will not be disappointed ,5
my mouse no matter how charged it is loves to just randomly jump to the side of my screen it been like this since first plugged it in besides that it pretty and like how the lights combined it also really helped me with my carpal tunnel issues ,5

my yr old daughter is new to gaming and loves to game with my yr old nephews got them each this head set and so far they love it really didn want to spend on gaming headsets these are very reasonably priced and worth it definitely recommend it ,1
nice keyboard does not come charged just plugin and works fine quick sleep mode and once you touch the keyboard the lights come on don like that and hope change it just haven been able to yet overall it smooth to type and is not loud at all ,5
not worth it had this for only months and it broke it just stopped working could not scroll at all no matter what did not worth the money then after contacting amazon was charged dollar restocking fee for them and had to send it back on my own ,1
plugged right into my ps controller and works exceptionally well if being honest these are just as good as the pair was gifted that broke which is why purchased these and eventually when these wear out will be repurchasing them can beat the price for the great quality ,1
probably the best bluetooth speaker on the market for the price paid it slaps af the battery life is wassup still haven dunked it in water but it nice to know that if it does get wet it ll be alright would definitely buy this bad boy again ,5
the box was torn and there is scratch smudge on it hope it works well the colors are beautiful though love how the white mouse looks it very clean stars because of the smudge can get off and packaging it obvious not the first one to own it ,5

the keyboard when it lights up makes strange high pitched buzz hearing that none stop would definitely cause headache in addition the keys are very loud especially the spacebar it does look pretty cool when lit but there is no way could have handled the buzz none stop ,5
the microphone does not work ive tried all troubleshooting options and ive actually gotten sound by doing abunch of settings bs but the mic itself is just bad and the headset feels cheap its cheap headser im aware like the plastic and everything is just not worth it,5
the mouse feels great in your hand is delightfully colorful but doesn scroll down the page was only able to click down which is bothersome on web pages would return it but threw out the box if you don get defective one its good buy for the price ,5

the speakers sound amazing and the two that purchased immediately paired using the jbl connect app my only concern is that neither charging door closes tightly or seals shut which makes me believe that they wouldn be waterproof since water or liquids would easily enter the usb ports ,5
there something wrong with this mouse and see not alone if leave it alone for like minutes it stops working and can be woken back up ve tried powering it on and off unplugging the usb charging the dang thing just decided not to work any more returning ,5

thing sounds great until it shorts literally had the thing month and it shorted out and will not work contacted jbl harmon and was essentially scoffed at since then ve replaced both the battery and motherboard to no avail cannot remember the last time wasted nearly like this ,5

this is my first high quality bluetooth speaker am totally blown away by the sound and the battery life bought the big red one and really like it the charge is much bigger than the charge have charge case and it tough fit this speaker is really cool ,5
this is the perfect little speaker that has great sound picks up everything from hip hop to edm to instrumental very good quality sound and the bluetooth connection is the easiest ve ever used get from my car to the house and it instantly picks up the music,5
this keyboard may look cool but that about it the keys are not button like like the one brand normally use so typing with average size nails is difficult it makes way too much noice for my comfort am returning the product because it doesn meet my expectations ,5
this mouse is awful bought six weeks ago and one of them died in less than week the other just died got less than months out of these and now have to go looking again for more reliable one avoid this it looks nice but it doesn last,1

wish it was bigger using it out by the horseshoe pit and in my room at night it sounds great but it not enough sound to rock the block battery life is shorter then what they say but probably lasts long enough to get thru whatever your doing ,5
you sound very terrible on this headset you can mute yourself even with doing the mic mute switch and your sound is very quiet compared to other head sets it cheaper than most head sets but their are some big setbacks would not buy again would not recommend,5
 bought this as replacement headset for my work at home job and the sound quality coming in is nice but the sound quality going out is super muffled the ear muffs are also on the smaller side but that just means have larger than average ears lol,1
 ive had for about year and only used it on occasion it worked pretty good until started using it on regular basis mouse slowly stopped working more and more until now it doesn track any movement at all do not buy unless you want to throw away,1

after maybe three months of use started experiencing issues with it staying powered on and connecting to my pc would try typing and the keys simply wouldn work and would keep turning off overall my experience with this keyboard has been very poor and don recommend it ,5
edit customer service was very responsive they walked me through resetting it they said if it didn work that would covered under warranty luckily it was quick and easy fix the keyboard worked great for month then it stopped working it won work and it won charge ,5
good value for the money sound quality is ok cord seems ridiculously long but perhaps it because it works on the pc too using for xbox comfortable to wear kind of big in size so if it for kid just know it may be enormous on them ,5
great keyboard for the price really like the feel of the keys not used to the enter key yet having notch out where the key is but not big deal also wish it had dedicated volume keys as well as opposed to pressing the fn key first ,5
i am really disappointed with this keyboard at first it was great but within month or two the keyboard started to glitch certain buttons do not work when press them considering the price of the product was happy but not if it stops working after two months ,5

it good for pinch it doesn have the best quality also it not for console gaming the led lights needs to be hooked up to usb in order to light up wouldn recommend if you want to play on console ended up going back to turtle beach ,5
it good size weight and shape but it bothers me that you can turn the red light off when you move it if you have the rainbow light on the red light still goes on when you move it so you don really get the rainbow effect,5
it nice sleek mouse and works relatively well until it stops charging had bought it early march this year and now early may it won charge making it hunk of useless plastic buy with the expectation you will have to buy again and not very long thereafter ,1

it not the worst and it certainly not the best but overall think that it was bit too expensive for its quality it it supper uncomfortable the mic is supper quiet and there is no way to turn it up overall highly recommend getting turtle beach headset ,5

it was initially pretty decent keyboard but after few months things started going wrongthe spacebar started sticking in the pressed state and after about year it stopped recharging and it keeps turning off and on with every key pressprice is in par with quality guess disappointment nonetheless,1

son uses for gaming and watching school videos and listening to audio books says they are very comfortable don hurt his ears sound quality is great dual plugs adapters means he can use them with laptop or his mp player can beat the quality for the price ,1
super easy to use just plug in to do the initial charge and then recharge via the usb cord as needed kinda fun to have the light display change colors throughout the day soft touch when you right or left click and barely makes any clicking noise ,1

the headphones are made for children heads the earpieces don cover an adult ears the plastic and shape of the headset itself feels cheap and breakable the microphone quality is atrocious and makes anyone speaking through it sound like the stereotypical kid screaming into mic on fortnite ,5
the mouse drags after use for like an hour battery does not last too long it takes longer to charge then the amount of time been use will not buy look for better quality name brand do not recomend at all wish can get my money back,5

junk charged it and used it several times it worked for about handful of times charged again the light on the switch flashes but turns off immediately so that it won go on even though it is charged save your money and by well known brand,5
just doesn connect also doesn come with instructions except lousy troubleshooting that essentially just says to restart your computer and try plugging it into other devices sure let me grab all my other computers also no tech phone tech support and it not really silent bye ,5
loving the fact that the sound quality is this amazing also beyond thrilled that can wear them for hours and not have to worry about them hurting my ears when wearing them have size gauged ears so it is awesome overall very happy with my headphones ,5

not what expected hate the sleep feature only stays lit for few seconds and there no way to by pass it wanted lit keyboard so can find the key need in the dark also would not recommend for gaming as the key strokes don always register,5
not worth the money at all it just standard keyboard that slides all over the place and occasionally lights up missing grips and the lights won stay on longer than seconds which is why wanted it in the first place for when working at night pointless,1
overall this is very well priced keyboard and perfect for someone on budget my only issues was that the key press took abit of getting used to and the travel was tad too shallow for my personal liking function and feature wise no complaints at all ,5
previously drop mouse by accident and found right button is disable comment to seller and they were so generous to offer refund although merchandise has been used for sometimes compliments and respect to their excellent customer service and business attitude support their product again in future ,5

the mouse is cute and light but it doesn consistently work throughout the day it will be working and then all of sudden it will be non responsive and has to be turned off and back on to get it to work again would not recommend ,1

the wires are flimsy around the audio jack and mic jack to the point that you have to adjust them specific way to get sound to come out of both sides of the headset accidently move the wire and you have to try to readjust it ,5
they looked cool and the comfort was not bad but no matter how much adjusted settings and played with them people had hard time hearing me over mic got annoyed and gave them away as did not want to go through the hassle of returning them ,5
this item exceeded my expectations it is good size but not too large to handle easily the sound loudness and clarity is excellent we own the smaller version that we have been pleased with but this one is great for outdoor use would purchase this again ,5

the controller on the wire is nice sometimes the wire gets in the way when gaming it takes second to get used to the headphones after you put them on they are nice can comfortable not good at noise cancelling but otherwise they are great ,5
the cursor acts erratically and the left and right buttons respond poorly one must work twice as hard to use this than any other mouse have ever had seek elsewhere go to local store where you can easily return the thing if you need to ,5
the keys have an unusual silky feet that kinda like unexpected like the ability to see the keyboard in total darkness and love the colorfulness of it like the key selection and the ability to adjust volume even if the screen is off nice keyboard ,1

you can barely hear your game gave up and just used my speakers on the computer monitor so could hear enemies and what not all these do is block noise like pair of lighted ear muffs they do not enhance game play in the least ,5
you dont hear any clicking like normal mouses which is nice the color is good and smooth as well my only complaint is you have to move it back and forth sometimes to wake it up rather than that its perfect mouse when its awake ,1

actually was very pleased especially for the price they work great the cord could have been little longer like my other gaming headsets but just plugged the headset into the controller and they work great so for the price think you ll be pleased ,5
all in all this keyboard is pretty good the key stroke is little long for my liking but ve grown accustomed to how hard to press the keys at first was missing lot of letters onscreen but after like week the typing became easy ,1
although there is large american flag pictured on the product description this keyboard is made in china nowhere in the description does it say that paid premium for this keyboard for it to be made in the us and this is just false advertising ,1
another piece of china junk sold through amazon charged until the light went off mouse charged plugged it in and it stopped working minutes later did the same thing second time same result thanks amazon for continuing to peddle garbage products to your customers ,5

does right after charging didn quite work right out of the box had to turn on rainbow led light to even get it to work will not work without that turned on now it won hold charge for more than minutes after maybe weeks ,1
easy to use directly from it box simply charge it with the usb cord included plug in the dongle receiver to your device reboot your device and it locates and installs itself turn the mouse on and your ready to work or play etc,5
excellent detailed sound for video games say if you have an average vizio tv like me these headphones are better quality experience very comfy they really surround my ears completely the mic arm is very tight stable the tangle free chord feels like cloth ,5
excellent purchase provides great back lighting for typing in low or no light situations great feel to the keys and excellent range have been using for days now on the initial charge and am very happy with the power capacity so far highly recommend ,5
for sure it nothing for professional gaming and music but for that value it really good you can do anything wrong with if you don have high expectations and look for an spare device my daughter is happy with good quality for good price,5
good sound all my coworkers want one or two bought this for camping can hide this behind log and start my show going to freak them out lol this will do the job my son has his and the sink up easy to operate,5
got of these they work really well but it has to be plugged into the usb in order for it to light up which is stupid you can use them on controller without also plugging the usb into something else but great for pc ,5
had some issues with my first headphones purchased and customer service reached out to me to rectify the situation and the new pair they sent is amazing pleasantly surprised with the quality thank you guys again for going above and beyond for your customers ,5

i love the keyboard just wish there was switch to keep the lights on while using it but actually understand that it would require it to be charged more so either way love the freaking keyboard it made my work life little more simplified ,5
i not the greatest at typing numbers thought this would be good night time solution to see the number buttons but the light is too dim as well as the numbers printed too small on the keyboard found the battery life lacking as well ,5

it works amazing there wasn anything wrong ordered them to play the game with my little cousin and not the kind to buy headset then saw these and they came in before expected they are light got long wire and the sound is perfect ,1
just waited long enough so that the return policy wore out fantastic regardless of that the mouse is smooth to hold and enjoyed using it for the little time got to use it make sure to test the charging port if you buy it,5
keep reading reviews that boast about the bass not true at all only provides mid bass and not low pass so it sounds muffled and offbeat when listening to music with very low bass that was important to me and the reviews were misleading ,5
lasted about months we bought cheap headset knowing they wouldn last long my son is hard in headsets so at this point it better to order cheap and replace often instead of really expensive ones that still don last good quality for the value,1
love this speaker the sound is amazing the battery life is great plus you can use it as power bank to charge your usb devices as for portability it would be best to buy the protective case with clips would buy again and again,5
my year old son loves this headset he just received it for his birthday we haven texted all of the features and aren sure if the mic works yet but he still enjoying it update mic works and he very happy with the gift ,5
not bad for the money but keys are very stiff and not ideal for typing prolong use will cause finger and wrist pain wanting to find quieter alternative for my razer mechanical keyboard but this one does not cut it it is quiet though ,1
our year old son asked for this headset for his nintendo switch gaming used it for the first time yesterday when listening to youtube video regarding printing this headset has amazing sound quality and clarity highly recommend this headset the price is on point ,5
overall love the build and the color and feel of the keyboard but do not like the style of the enter key instead of tall enter key it would be better and more comfortable to have the long enter key like most standard keys ,5
piece of junk stopped working after day now the only way for the cursor to move is if you hold down the right mouse button how is that even possible did the mouse rewire itself not sure how this product is so highly rated ,5
pro solid build and good looking sound quality good microphone worked as advertised and meet my expectations reasonable price con bulky for kid under years old but ok for adult usb light needed adapter not included but don use it so not big deal ,1
purchased as an alternative to wired mouse along with having spare to throw in my work bag in case of issues ended up designating this mouse for use with my home security system and it working as expected no issues after the first charge ,1

sound quality is very good better bass response than my charge good battery life rugged waterproof good max volume level overall an excellent product the only downside is it bit too large to fit in bicycle bottle cage charge works well for that purpose ,1
the cord is stupid it like its backwards only way to use the lights is plug the cord in and the cord for the lighst is literally foot long that means you are foot in front of the tv when you play game ridiculous,5
the first day it worked great but the second day it barely tracks at all and when try and click on anything to open documents or emails it takes several tries before it works what waste of money going back to my old mouse ,1

the headline says it all these sound great and have pretty good noise cancellation but they are very uncomfortable could only wear them for short amount of time before reverting back to my old headphones ended up throwing them away because won use them ,1
the headphones were great they had excellent sound quality the microphone had few issues the audio it pur out was alittle disappointing but with few small adjustments was able to work properly would recommend to any game looking for affordable and good quality headset ,5
the mouse is nicely shaped and feels nice in your hand the clicking is quiet the only problem is that it does not stay charged more than one day so have to keep it plugged in which defeats the purpose of having wireless mouse ,1

the usb got stuck in my computer as soon as put it in decided to put up with it hoping the mouse would last and wouldn have to worry about it it worked for maybe month total then completely stopped working and wouldn charge ,5
the usb plug in is not long enough to connect to the playstation the cord is so long but splits into two six inch cords one goes into the playstation the other goes into the controller what the hell are you supposed to do,5
the usb receiver was missing upon opening which was the main reason got this mouse tried using it with another laptop and after fully charging it it would not work after charging for hours and hours again it still would not work very disappointed ,1

the volume is as high as the jbl flip it looks bigger but it not as high it was huge disappointment what the point of it being bulky if the sound is not high stick to the flip cheaper and sounds exactly the same ,5
there is literally an extra key between the and the enter key the is before the enter key guess if was more of gamer maybe this would make sense but since want to type more this is terrible why would you change keyboard layout ,5
these are very good quality set for the sub the only thing that could be better is the max volume could be higher but they are still very good other than that am very pleased and would purchase this product again in the future ,5
these headphones are awesome they re great for the money they cancel out the noise they work perfect they were just bought for my significant other for work and she loves them am willing to bet they would great for gaming though great sound ,1
this company has great costumer service we have some issues they resolve with no excuses or delays very professional love the way they handle make me fell very appreciate has customer with you don see much this days thank you very recommend the product ,5

this is my th or th jbl charge that we have purchased either for us or for gift to someone else love how you can connect all of them together for an exceptional sound experience battery life is very long too would highly recommend ,5
this is really nice wireless keyboard if you don need too many bells whistles game on my tv so sit pretty far away and haven had trouble with connectivity yet the rgb is simple but nice and switching between the different modes is easy ,5
this is supposed to be an upgrade from charge but they decided to only put one primary driver in and it shows bass response is good but the music sound incomplete either stick with the charge or pony up little more for the extreme ,5
this keyboard has range of about inches and minutes of game time it is not responsive and most likely the chat will have moved on by the time the keyboard decides to start inputting what you are typing had it for less than week ,5
this keyboard was great buy at am forced to replace it months later keys getting soft worn which would have been fine at the price point but now the price has almost doubled going to seek out more reliable brand for slightly more money,1
this mouse feels very sleek to the hand however the battery only lasts about hours and takes about an hour to charge fully the led lights are not very bright even when turn the feature off the mouse still dies in about three hours ,5

this speaker was great addition to my back deck it provides just enough volume and bass to make music enjoyable without being too overpowering the charge port is great for friends who need to charge their phone while it plays our audio love it ,5

we are really enjoying our jbl charge speaker we use it all the time especially in the golf cart and hot tub it stays charged for long time and is easy to bluetooth to my phone we are very glad that we bought it ,1
while these headphones offer great value would recommend them to anyone but gamers this is annoying while gaming because they are very loose and gets you distracted even after putting it on tight most setting it undoes the setting have rather average sized head ,1
wireless connectivity is pretty bad my keyboard is on desk ft away from my tower which is on the ground if shift the keyboard too far it will result in loss of keystroke recognition connectivity will be intermittent will most likely return this one ,5
 stars because like others experienced left ctrl shift does not register with all keys guessing they didn map all of those or something alternative use is left ctrl right shift if you don use this key combo often then this is fantastic product ,5
after having this mouse for weeks it stopped working computer doesn recognize the usb and wont pair with it wirelessly this is the replacement for the original one that broke after being dropped short distance no way of contacting the seller very disappointed,5

excellent battery life so far right out of the box with no charge it lasted hours straight sound quality excellent little larger and heavier than thought it would be perfect for working in kitchen but little too big for my disc golf bag ,5
from the several bluetooth speakers ve owned for nearly years this significantly has the clearest and best quality sound of them all notice that percussion is distinctively clearer from any bluetooth speaker ve heard as well jbl always delivers top notch durable product ,5

i ve never used high quality headset but this one has been huge upgrade from using regular ear buds the downside is that the cable is heavy and constantly pulling on the headset it really needs clip to attach cable to your shirt ,5
i was left speachless when first played this speaker amazing sound incredible battery life something that ve noticed with the time that when doing the jbl connect thing when joining multiple speakers it goes crazy sometimes it freezes and must do hard shutdown ,1
if could put zero stars would my order came with the correct packaging but as soon as opened it it was not the speaker that is advertised someone replaced the speaker with used black speaker that isn even the same brand completely ridiculous ,5
it advertise change of color of the light mine is only red the buttons have to hit it very had to the point that started to click on the board because my finger hurt very pretty very sleek so far works very good ,5

its nice to carry around as portable charger that can play music as for sound quality your better off purchasing the flip which outperforms the charge the only upside found was that the charge was better and deep tones flip for the win,1

overall decent headset for the price the sound is pretty average but the microphone is pretty horrible if you plan on using it for meetings or discord calls buy different headset because you re going to have lot of trouble with this one ,1
paid for the razer blackshark gaming headset months ago and the mic doesn work most of the time specifically while playing fortnite on ps paid for this bengoo stereo gaming headset and the speakers and mic sound and work fantastic don pay more ,1
previous versions of this speaker have much better sound quality was very disappointed in the sound of the bluetooth audio coming through this speaker also the delay between multiple speakers playing the same song is very noticeable when you link these speakers together,5

the headset is great sounds great not so great in noice cancelling and my ears hurt after while using them because have glasses and they squish my them to my glasses but aside from that they are great and great sound ,5

junk my son barely used these for month maybe total of hours and the sound stopped working the sound stopped working on one side and then days later both sides gave out all together don waste your money ,5
lasts for few hours at close to max volume and obviously longer the lower the volume is great over all for the price but the back has an annoying clicking sound like the screws to panel are lose ,5
left control key doesnt work for some use cases for whatever reason so it annoying to have to use the right control key also no fn lock long story short looks good but crappy functionality pick another keyboard,5
like the rechargeable battery part the most bought this for my gaming grandson and he is happy with it will soon be buying one for me to replace my aging keyboard liked wireless keyboards but hated replacing batteries ,5

misleading information purchased this as gift you can only use the lights or the microphone and speakers on the ps you can use them at the same time unless you want the console on your lap very disappointed ,5
money well spent love that the cable is thick and less likely to break and the sounds quality is top notch definitely recommend for gamers or even if you wanna listen to music and tune the world out ,1

purchased it for my son who is gamer he picked it out after doing the research on amazon he really enjoys the every aspect of the keyboard it is lightweight therefore he has taken it with him abroad ,5
sound quality excellent easy to connect check the box carefully or you will miss the compartment that holdsthe charger like did have only had to charge it once after more than months no hunt for the right adapters,5
stopped working less than hours after received the package it would cost me more to return it than what paid for it so it just sitting in my office making clutter honestly would not recommend it at all ,5
the connection as wireless mouse works well however clicking is challenge am not sure how to explain it it is not ergometric and it doesn click am not sure why people would enjoy this mouse don recommend it ,1
the headset goes hard it was on the more budget end but feels sturdy and came with an excellent chord adapters the sound quality is good and the mic pickup fairs well this product is an excellent choice ,5
the mic quality is more clearer than if you were to plug your plain headphones in it more decent sound quality the build is pretty light due to plastic structure but what do you expect from dollar purchase ,5

the noise cancellation is great had these headphones for little over year before my dog thought it be cute to chew through the extra thick braiding on the cord would recommend trying these if you re on budget ,5
the on off switch is on the bottom ofthe keyboard you have to pick it up and flip it over it is very small and in an indent and hard to move going to be chaging it lot ,1
the pads are really nice the mic rests in comfortable spot for sound it really is nice headset the ability to use single or double plug is really nice and makes it easy to switch to different devices,5
the sound from this is great it been to many parties and outside and the beach would highly recommend it bluetooth works great my older parents can even use it with ease getting them one for their anniversary ,5
these worked great for month we received them on june nd and they stopped working by august th was attempting to contact the seller and can not for any reason get in touch with them do not buy ,5
this does work with the xbox series you do need to adjust the volume initially on the xbox itself the led lights only work when connected to usb overall great sound but wish the bass was little better,5
this is great little mouse for someone like me that has smaller hands and some nerve issues as well it is light not bulky and works so smoothly would highly recommend it and will purchase another for friend ,1

this thing is awesome it came charged when it was delivered and ve used it pretty much daily in the classroom during the week weeks later it finally died sound quality is great too well worth the money,5
this was good for couple weeks and then the reception became extremely poor would personally go for another keyboard in my opinion also amazon will not refund it bs if you ask me just go with wired keyboard ,5
this was not easy hook up you have to do to much to connect to game and to get them to work just went to game stop and brought different ones my kids wanted to play there games,1
usb connection is weird for ps doesn work for anything but charging comfortable ear piece and good price but sound quality on highest setting is mediocre at best decent treble and bass levels too but output is garbage ,5

absolutely love everything about this speaker great sound and connects well it even says waterproof well we accidentally dropped it on our hot tub and it still works amazing so give it stars for very good speaker,5
after about two months mine stopped holding charge although it works plugged in also noticed that space bar has gotten to be really loud compared to the keys it looks super cute with the rainbow lights though ,1
after months of somewhat daily usage just for checking emails occasionally or something fast the middle wheel stopped working making it pain in my ass to use would recommend staying clear since it only has day warranty ,1
although this mouse is nice and worked well for work it is not meant for extensive use after exactly one month this mouse no longer works in addition this coincides with the return window closing literally yesterday ,5
as soon as it ran out of charge the mouse died permanently tried charging it for hours in the hopes that full charge would cause it to work again but it didn would not recommend this mouse ,1
as you can see my son lives by these headphones he not only uses them for gaming he also uses them for his virtual learning as well the quality is clear and the noise cancellation is excellent ,5
bought this for kids doing schoolwork from home and for gaming my kids love them and we bought more pair do not confuse these with higher end headsets but they are certainly fantastic value at their pricepoint ,1

excellent headset for the price easy to use with windows plug and play sits over the ear so the noise cancelling is passive you can still somewhat hear things going on around you but its not disturbing,5

the keyboard came today and so far really enjoying it looks sleek and feels nice for the price say that this is great buy no problems to report but it only day one came very fast ,5
the keyboard is great in general but the usb receiver broke off in my usb port after months they really should either include more than one receiver or make them more robust and of higher quality ,5
the lights only work if you use the usb plug which is not practical for video consoles like xbox and playstation sound quality is pretty good but pretty standard set of headsets without the light feature ,5

bruh this headset worked for few months then the light started to not work and then my input was all messed up can get corsair headset for just dollars more and it would be better,5

excellent bluetooth speaker well built and also great sound quality links to harman kardon speakers and also other jbl speakers definitely recommend purchasing if you re looking for great sounding long lasting battery bluetooth speaker ,1
excellent sound great bass and treble but it doesn seem possible to change any equalizer settings every time the speaker is turned on off it makes rather loud noise it pleasant just kind of loud ,5
feels like you can turn it up loud enough for some games could be decibel limiter the bass is usually overpowered but not terrible product treble is good quality but bit on the quiet side ,1

i wound up returning because non longer needed it but it did try it out and it worked amazingly love how quiet and sleek it was and the adapter was perfect for my macbook ,1
impressed by some headphones my only gripe is the mic is on the left side of your face and you cant rotate the mic to switch it to the right other than that happy ,5
it good and all loud volume and noise cancelation but it has really long cables its probably for pc but also says ps so now have mic with long cable connected to my controller,5

looked cool cancels sound ok but def hard to hear xbox or tablet laptop audio at full volume and also def not good for game chat or work calls on laptop for both parties,1
loud enough for what needed it for battery life depends on how loud you use it don forget to turn it off when you are not using it and the battery will last longer ,5
my husband has been wanting speaker like this for while this was deal of day so jumped on it he is so happy with this speaker thanks for great deal and extremely fast shipping ,5
my only problem with this headset is that have to have my computer volume up to use them also have to turn the platform volume up to even then everything seems little muted still ,5
my son uses these headphones for pc games the head phones arrived quickly they work great and have great noise canceling capabilities the blue lights are also an added extra for year old boy ,5
my three cents just the jbl charge and the portable speaker bass and sound quality are great for the price you can charge it while using it so it doesn need to be portable ,5
my year old loves the blue light of the headset it looks cool and the sound quality is good only downside is it bit heavy my opinion my son doesn care he loves it ,5
nice packaging counts for little when the instruction manual tells you nothing about how to use it had to go to youtube also for touch typists you may find it too soft quiet returned,1
not sure about the battery life as just got it and haven used it for any length of time the seller however was efficient and it seems like decent value at the price point ,5
only complaint is usb cord was too short to plug into my computer for the lights on the headphone my laptop had an outlet on the left side and attached cord would not reach ,5
perfect little speaker jam around the house with it or take it with you wherever battery will last me days and this thing even has bass perfect for my fishing trips or camping trips ,5

really amazing headphones for beginner gamers it has really good sound quality mic quality and overall good quality in general definitely would recommend to anyone for cheap bang for your buck headset ,5
reasonably priced and beautiful chroma lighting effects on keyboard the keyboard is indeed silent but somehow the lack of tactile feedback sometimes makes one wonder if the keys had been depressed correctly ,5
so far this holds decent charge and its really nice for my wah job that requires tons of typing the space bar makes weird squeaking noise but other than that love this ,5
so really like it like you can shut of the lights if you want it is sensitive so your mouse moves very easily and it very easy for person who has laptop ,5

some keys stopped working months of use contacted the klim for assistance and was not able to get the keyboard exchanged for new one will no longer purchase any electronics from klim ,5
sounds is decent can hear other crisp and clear if you want the lights to work plug in the usb long cable so you aren tied so close to your device controller ,5
speaker has clean sound just not loud enough to justify the increase in price the sound was huge disappointment if you like anything loud don buy the speaker stay with the charge ,5
the audio is great the mic works well will totally buy them again this is my second pair because my dog ate my first one that how good they were percent satisfied ,5
the bass definitely leaves something to be desired definitely proves why ve been fan of bose for so long bought this speaker for change of pace it no go for me personally ,5

the only way the lights works if you plug into the xbox port then there is inch cord to plug into the controller for the mic which doesn work very poor design ,1
the price is worth getting but find it kind dumb that you need to be right by your console to connect and turn on the lights but good headphones to start tho ,5
the product is just fine looks like jbl but clearly they lied about hours worth of music battery life plan on returning it and just going to big box store next time ,5
the product is not worth the price because the keys are too big the lights are dimmed and it felt poorly made in general although it worked correctly would spend money elsewhere,5
the reason why this product has good reviews is because the seller told buyers to vote them many stars and they will get the gift as commission however they just scam buyers ,5
the receiver is located at the bottom of the mouse which is theory is great idea however it stuck way too deep and can get it out without breaking something very sad ,5
the sounds not so good but loud enough my main issue was connection to my computer speaker had to restart my computer whenever change from my bluetooth ear phone to this speaker ,5
then it continued to be cheap piece of junk mean should have known from the price it was to good to be true never got it to charge or do anything returned ,1

just not enough bass on the flip side bought the next step up the jbl boom box and it had to much bass chose too much bass over to little bass ,5
keys stop responding after few weeks contacted the manufacturer tried to fix but no luck received replacement and again within days keys don respond incredibly frustrating do not recommend this product ,5

much better in all categories than the bose soundlink had before ve had this for few months now and no complaints this little speaker produces great sound and lot of bass ,5
my son really loves this headset he likes that the microphone can bend we needed help fixing something and the customer service was super helpful and quick to make things right ,1
my team usually has hard time hearing anything saying due to the headsets poor microphone the sound quality is fair and the long and bulky cord can be bit of nuisance,5
never had an issue with refurbished until this one was dirty and won turn on recommend not getting used one it worth the time and extra money to get it new ,5
of course weeks after return window closes the mouse stops working slow movement and doesn respond to commands waste of plastic update seller offered to make this right awaiting final resolution,1

ok admit it love the colors necessary nope super fun yup just adds little playfulness to my office desk works great comes with charging cord charge lasts long time love it ,5
okay so for this to work on pc apparently you have to have mic and headphone jack no laptops have microphone jacks this product is essentially useless do not purchase it ,5
omg ve my speaker it better the cheapest speaker have in my backpack that cheap one whack and the jbl speaker is way beyond better ve it so much thanks amazon ,5
only had the thing for week and already the mic stopped working can hear them they can hear me have to unplug and replug dozen times for it to work again,1
perfect low profile for me not sure how long the charge will last with the led on but you can switch them off for the price nothing to complain about thanks,5
perfect no complaints super cute color changes never charge it and it only died once and use it for work about hours day and seems like charge it like times week ,5
personally would prefer if light stay up longer or can extend that some how know it will drain battery but would just charge more often but besides of that love it ,5
product was great it arrived fast and sounds good mic quality was also good and it also had great noise canceling could barely hear my dog bark right next to me ,5

really nice headset sounds good and all the cable is extremely long came all twisted up and the sound would cut if tried to untangle it so had to return it ,5
so at work and my buddy has the flip have the charge theyre the same in volume upset because this scheme cost me more and had buy the case separately bucocky ,5

so got this for sitting by the fire at night with the family now take it everywhere need great sound ve even used in place of my bose speaker rate this ,5
solid comfortable headset that doesn squeeze your brain cheap and pretty sturdy and quality for the price could noise cancel better better sound quality than expected perfect gift for the youngins,5
sound quality is good overall would give it stars if it came with the carrying case as the charge did overall nice little speaker for taking to the lake or camping ,5
sound quality speaking and hearing are excellent but definitely not meant for consoles the usb and aux jack are right next to each other so no led lights for console players ,1
sounds ok does decent but after month my friends can hear me correctly sound fuzzy and broken to them but the game audio is ok using it on xbox series x,5
sounds quality is amazing battery last very long and the overall built quality is just good never ever reviewed something and gave it five star but this one absolutely deserves it ,5

sucks that buys you keyboard that just dies after couple weeks know this only happens to some people that buy the product so if you wanna roll the dice go ahead ,1
the and keys sometimes the key and the enter key just stopped working two months after bought this thing never leave reviews but this is truly unacceptable do not buy period ,5
the audio works really well on my ps good quality and definitely worth the buy only issue is the light cable is too short and is an issue for console players ,5
the enter key is hard to press after month on these keyboards tried two of them but no difference im not out of the return window and am stuck with it ,5
the game sound and chat sound great fits alittle tight but it might just be that have big head definitely love this more than the dollar xbox headset got at walmart ,5
the keyboard does say wireless but if do not have it plugged into the usb port it will not work they replaced it immediately with keyboard that works correctly thank you ,5
the keyboard works as it should for regular keyboard maybe just picky for gaming items they need to be quick and smooth this is not it works well for regular typing,5
the mouse falls asleep right away the cord for recharging is only about in in long constantly needs to be recharged it is definitely not five star product it looks cool ,5
the mouse is big enough to use and very smooth with my computer always look for wireless mouse so this one is the best on amazon that could find highly recommended ,1

the wheel on this mouse if very flimsy it has failed on two of the devices ordered would not recommend this product it not even suitable for the lightest of duties ,1
there are multiple times the keyboard does not register my keystrokes causing typos in word processing and issues when gaming defeats the purpose of having keyboard imo it looks nice though ,5

these work great for gaming can easily tell what direction sounds are coming from in cod and apex legends for first person shooter games these work great and are very comfortable ,5
they are nice fit the only thing that could make them better if is the microphone could rotate to go both ways like to wear the mic on my right side ,5
they didn work they aren loud and they are really confusing to use but too priority is the fact that they are not remotely loud or noise canceling they don work,5
they don light up blue like it shows on the picture the sound is vary poor they are not loud enough for you to hear the game don waste your money ,1
they look like the photo the set comes with appropriate cords they work so far noise cancellation got only stars because can still hear people talking at normal volume around me ,5
they re just cheap quality and they re not really comfortable mic isn that good and they literally snap crackle and pop when you go to put them on your head ,5
this cable is so short when you plug it into any of the computers usb ports the mouse is suspended in mid air avoid by the way it doesn take batteries ,5
this headset died after less than month of regular use no loud music only used for gaming voice chat they just randomly died total junk save your money buy something else ,1
this headset is an excellent choice for gamers whether you just want to hear your games up close and personal or you intend to stream live gameplay this headset is great ,5
this headset is very comfortable with good sound and mic got the purple for myself and the pink one for my daughter and they are both very pretty and work great ,5
this is good set of headphones but if you use the microphone for gaming the majority of people say you sound like you are talking into tin can down hallway lol,5

replaced an old jbl speaker which only lasted hours the battery and sound quality of this jbl charge speaker is outstanding and highly recommend it battery lasts for hours ,5
seems nice enough in the hand but didn work could click both the left and right mouse buttons but moving the mouse would not do anything had to return ,5
so far have been loving this keyboard have not had any drop outs on the wireless would recommend for anyone causal but serious gamers know to always go wired ,1
so far it seems to be working well hard to connect with the blue tooth have to fuss wish the base was better it ok but would like more ,5
so if you re looking for top of the line gaming headphones these aren it but they look really cool and sound pretty good you can beat the price ,5
so loved this and use computer daily so you could say it is only intended for rare usage it broke within the month was sad specifically the scrolling button ,5

speaker sounds great but now just cuts off after months of use super annoying having to reconnect unfortunately outside of the service window but hoping jbl will fix it ,5
super functional if you want medium portable speaker with very good sound this is perfect sounds really good if you want more volumen you may look for big one ,5
the bass was little bit of let down but compared to any speaker ve ever had including my beats pill it great hear all the dimensions in the music ,5
the battery lasted about hours not the as advertised the sound is fine guess it really treble and there isn way to adjust it overall disappointed in this speaker ,5
the box came opened and smashed the microphone barely worked at all and now simply does not work the sound is fine the microphone was just an important part ,1
the cord is very long and usually gets in the way when first got my it would make static noises and also echo other people suggest getting different mic ,5
the keyboard did not function correctly the moment opened plugged it some of the keys just don work received broken keyboard and it pain to return due to covid ,1
the lights on the side of the mouse are not as bright as thought they would be but still like the mouse none the less quiet clicking charges quickly ,1

the product has good sound quality and can produce good sound the feature of being able to mute with switch and being able to adjust the volume is nice ,5

the sound of these speakers are mediocre to poor the bluetooth connection continually misfires and sound dissolves into static was surprised that this kind of speaker gets good marks ,5
the sound of this small unit fills my living room for the money would recommend this like that it can connect to other devices and give full surround experience ,5
the tracking on this mouse is not great and to add insult to injury the mouse stopped working after about months worse yet missed the return window by days ,5
there is so much unnecessary wiring really excessive amount of weight for mic on off and volume false picture advertisement no blue light are in not worth the money ,5
these are not bad at all for the price whenever playing game online they work and sound great ve only had them about month now but no issues whatsoever ,5
they are not compatible with xbox and therefore advertising falsely don care that they work with an adapter not included any headphones work with an adapter therefore false advertising ,1
they have been being used daily since with no issues my son is the main user but ve borrowed them few times and will be ordering my own shortly ,5
they moved the back slash and pipe command key down next to the key and made the enter key taller keep hitting the key instead of the enter key ,1
